"In the second half of 2015, the humanitarian situation in Yemen continued to deteriorate. Continuous fighting, air strikes and the restrictions on commercial imports drove basic services to the verge of collapse. The upsurge in violence deepened the hardships faced by Yemenis, diminished the possibilities of protecting civilians, and displaced more and more people.

"The escalation of military conflict in 2015 has had a devastating impact on the lives of all Yemeni people. Their coping mechanisms were already stretched by years of instability, poor governance, lack of rule of law and widespread poverty. Before the conflict intensified in 2015, almost half of all Yemenis lived below the poverty line. That number drastically increased due to military operations and a sharp reduction in commercial imports. According to the 2015 Humanitarian Needs Overview, 80 per cent of Yemen’s population (21.1 million people) needed humanitarian assistance, mainly water, protection, food and health care. Out of the estimated 12.9 million people directly affected by the conflict, the 1 million internally displaced and 200,000 of the most vulnerable people in host communities bore the brunt of the suffering. An estimated 54 per cent of displaced people were women, who often supported their families despite long-standing gender inequalities and challenges accessing assistance. Rates of registered grave violations of child rights increased dramatically, including child deaths, injuries and recruitment to armed groups. Decreasing access to water and sanitation placed up to 2.5 million children at risk of diarrhoea and 1.3 million at risk of acute respiratory infections.",Report Available,380,2015,15-RR-YEM-15526,85,Yemen,YEM,3,Rapid Response,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,15-RR-YEM-15526_Yemen_Jun2015_Application,1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,14,Western Asia,15,Western Asia,3,Asia,21100000,IOM;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,25274293,2015-06-25,2015-07-02,Summary will be available soon.

The fighting also led to displacement, disrupted services and infrastructure losses, leaving many civilians without access to essential services. Among other needs, 2.9 million people were affected by insufficient access to a water supply and poor water quality, of whom 1.7 million were prioritized for urgent response activities.

"At the beginning of 2015, more than 233,000 Syrian refugees resided in the northern Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Intensified fighting in the northern Syrian town of Kobane at the end of 2014 triggered some 50,000 additional refugee arrivals to Iraq. The new influx put huge pressure on already overstretched humanitarian assistance as camp facilities and services were required to expand. Many of the new arrivals were women and children, some of whom had previously been displaced inside Syria or were refugees in Turkey. There was a critical need to strengthen protection and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) services, which struggled to address the large-scale needs. Public water and sanitation services were unable to meet the needs of growing refugee and host populations, leading to the failure of the water supply, sewage and wastewater treatment.

"With the conflict in Syria entering its fifth year in 2015, Jordan was hosting 646,700 registered refugees (though estimates were putting the actual number of Syrians in Jordan at 1.4 million). The majority of refugees lived outside the camps in some of the country’s poorest areas. As Syrian refugees in Jordan have not been allowed to work, thus relying heavily on humanitarian assistance, they were increasingly unable to meet their basic needs. In addition, Palestinian refugees from Syria were extremely marginalized and subjected to the Government’s policy of non-admission, which placed them at constant risk of refoulement. Shrinking protection space and resources, including reductions in WFP food assistance and restrictions on access to health care for refugees living outside camps, resulted in a sharp increase in negative coping mechanisms.

"Armed clashes between the Afghan Government forces and non-state armed groups in Kunduz, which took place from 28 September to 15 October 2015, resulted in some of the most intense fighting in Afghanistan since 2001. The aggressive campaign by non-state actors in Kunduz city and several other provincial centres (from Ghazni in the south to Maimana in the north) wreaked havoc, caused deaths and injuries, and provoked the widespread displacement of at least 16,800 families. The Kunduz regional airport, health facilities and schools were closed, while water, electrical and communication services were disrupted, which forced the evacuation of humanitarian personnel.

The crisis was followed by a devastating 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which struck the north and north-east of the country on 26 October. At least 15 provinces were affected, and 136,967 people needed humanitarian assistance.

"Between November 2015 and March 2016, Djibouti was confronted with the arrival of 7,500 nomadic pastoralists from the Somali Region of Ethiopia fleeing from one of the harshest droughts in the last decades. Given the severity of the drought in Ethiopia (10.2 million people affected), those numbers were expected to increase considerably over the following months, thus increasing the impact on already vulnerable host communities. The new arrivals indicated that they intended to stay in Djibouti until the situation improved, which meant they would not return before the next rainy season in July 2016. The new arrivals lost many of their livestock, were malnourished and had severe health problems, including measles. Pregnant women and children under age 5 showed signs of acute malnutrition and anemia.

"Recurrent drought and the residual effects of the border conflict with Ethiopia are underlying causes of vulnerability in Eritrea. Two thirds of the population rely on subsistence farming and pastoralism for livelihoods, rendering them vulnerable to climate variability. In a year of good agricultural production, Eritrea can produce an estimated maximum of 70 to 80 per cent of the annual cereal requirements. In a bad year, it can be as little as 20 to 30 per cent. El Niño, which disrupted rainfall patterns in 2015 and 2016, led to several consecutive poor harvests in Eritrea. However, the exact severity of the food shortfall could not be determined in the absence of recent assessment data.

"Madagascar experienced a long period of drought in 2015 and 2016, which led to significant losses in agricultural production and a slow-onset humanitarian emergency. A prolonged rain deficit caused large shortfalls in major food crops in the south, such as maize, cassava and rice. Apart from having a severe impact on livestock and agricultural production, the drought also caused a spike in the cost of water, resulting in an alarming decrease of water consumption among vulnerable communities. According to information collected by UNICEF, the price of 20 litres of water increased in 2016 from Ar200 to Ar1,400 in the most affected areas. As a result, the most vulnerable people in rural areas had to pay up to 28 times more for water than the people in urban areas. Three joint needs assessments conducted between January and February 2016 indicated that the number of people who were food insecure in southern Madagascar increased to 1.1 million (665,000 of whom were found to be severely food insecure).

"DRC experienced a major yellow fever epidemic following the influx of people seeking treatment from Angola. The epidemic was declared in Angola in January 2016, and the first case in DRC was recorded at the Lufu border crossing on 28 February 2016. Subsequently, the number of reported cases in DRC continued to increase, leading the Ministry of Health to declare a yellow fever outbreak on 23 April 2016. By 23 June, 68 confirmed cases, 1,307 suspected cases and 75 deaths were reported. In total, 60 health zones in six provinces were affected, which is just over 10 per cent of the total number of health zones in DRC. There was a high risk of the epidemic spreading to other provinces and outside DRC. The porous border between Angola and DRC, as well as frequent cross-border population movements, largely contributed to the spread of the disease. The size of the epidemic and the scope of the required response far exceeded the sizes of yellow fever outbreaks in the past 10 years.

"El Niño induced a dire drought in Angola during the second half of 2015, affecting more than 1.5 million people in six provinces. The affected areas were populated by agropastoralist ethnic groups, who seasonally move their livestock from one grazing ground to another seeking water and pasture. The region has experienced drought conditions since the 2011/2012 agricultural season, marked by a combination of rainfall deficits, uneven rain distribution and dry spells. The 2015 El Niño-induced drought led to losses of food, seeds, livelihood assets and livestock (an estimated 360,000 heads of cattle), which further exacerbated the vulnerability of the rural population. In areas with agriculture potential, farmers lost draught animals used for ploughing the fields. The agricultural losses were estimated at 52,000 tons of crops, affecting 82 per cent of the rural population. As a result, approximately 800,000 people were considered food insecure in the three provinces of Cunene, Huila and Namibe. The rates of severe acute malnutrition among children under age 5 increased from 3 to 6 per cent from June to November 2015. Access to safe water and adequate sanitation was also critical.

"On 25 July 2016, the Government of Côte d’Ivoire evicted illegal inhabitants of the Mont Peko National Park as part of a plan to save and restore the rainforest coverage. Despite the Government’s efforts to execute rights-based evacuation plans, measures to ensure the appropriate coverage of the needs of affected populations were not fully addressed. This led to the loss of homes and livelihoods of evicted people, who became displaced among the local communities in surrounding areas. According to the population count carried out by OCHA, UNICEF, and international and local NGOs, 25,532 displaced people were located within host communities, in temporary shelters and in open spaces around the national park.

Approximately 40,000 refugees returned between January and June and over 480,000 between July and December. The sudden and unprecedented spike in returns in the second half of the year was not planned for, and it far exceeded available response capacities. This mass movement was attributed to the unrelenting pressure on Afghan communities by Pakistani authorities through new visa requirements, police raids, detentions, deportations, and restricted access to livelihoods and social services.

"In mid-2016, 21.2 million people needed humanitarian assistance in Yemen, including 14.4 million people unable to meet their food needs; 19.3 million people who required humanitarian assistance to ensure access to safe drinking water and sanitation; and 14.1 million people who needed access to basic health care. The conflict resulted in the destruction and damage of infrastructure, economic decline and the collapse of public services. More than 2.3 million people were internally displaced and 170,000 fled the country. Yemen’s economy was in a state of near collapse, leading to sharp price increases of basic commodities, limited imports of food, fuel and medicines, a depreciation of the Yemeni rial and near exhaustion of central bank reserves. The Yemen Humanitarian Country Team developed the 2016 Humanitarian Response Plan based on the most urgent needs of the most vulnerable population. The plan aimed to assist 13.6 million of the most vulnerable people (65 per cent of those in need) with a range of essential life-saving and protection programmes.

"In March 2017, the sudden intensification of conflict in Yemen, especially on the western coast, further worsened the already severe humanitarian situation. Large numbers of people in need were cut off from public services and humanitarian assistance. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) for the period March to July 2017, 10.2 million people in Yemen were in IPC phase 3 (crisis) and 6.8 million people were in IPC phase 4 (emergency). In May 2017, the Food Security and Nutrition clusters issued an alert warning that the food security and nutrition situation would deteriorate further in many areas across western Yemen. Urgent humanitarian interventions were needed to prevent IPC phase 4 areas slipping into famine (IPC phase 5) and to avert a severe deterioration in food consumption, malnutrition and mortality. 

The deteriorating food security situation was coupled with general worsening of the humanitarian conditions in Yemen. All parties to the conflict repeatedly violated their obligations under international humanitarian law. Increasing and continuous import restrictions for food, fuel and medicines led to bottlenecks which further aggravated the humanitarian needs. A disaster needs assessment estimated that infrastructure losses amounted to $19 billion. In May 2017, some 45 per cent of the country’s health facilities were not functioning and 10.4 million people lacked access to health services, clean water and sanitation.

Reports from displaced people indicated that supply routes into western Mosul had been cut off and that there were severe shortages of food, medicines and other basic services. An inter-agency rapid needs assessment conducted in April 2017 indicated acute food shortages. By late April, the Government confirmed that food was one of the most immediate unmet needs in western Mosul.

Moreover, the drought decimated water reservoirs, wilted crops and dried rice paddy fields in five affected provinces: North and South Hwanghae, North and South Pyongan, and Nampo City. As of 23 June 2017, a total of 50,018 hectares of rice and maize fields were affected. Consequently, the average cereal ration of the Public Distribution System was reduced from 400 grams in June to 300 grams in July 2017.

"By 2017, eight years of violent conflict in north-east Nigeria had created one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. During 2016, the conflict intensified as the Nigerian Armed Forces took back areas previously held by Boko Haram. By the end of 2016 about 8.5 million people needed humanitarian assistance. Access to food and basic services was limited, and in the worst-affected and least accessible areas of Borno and Yobe states, severe forms of hunger and even famine-like conditions were occurring. Assessments predicted that 5.1 million people would be severely food insecure by mid-2017, including up to 450,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Additionally, water-borne diseases were on the rise due to inadequate access to water and sanitation facilities, and at least 3 million children were out of school. Among the most vulnerable were over 1.7 million internally displaced people (IDPs), of whom 55 per cent were children. People living in IDP camps and settlements faced constant threats, and rape, sexual assault and exploitation were prevalent. In line with escalating needs and the opening up of humanitarian access in some new areas, funding requirements increased from $484 million in 2016 to over $1 billion in 2017.

Violent conflict characterized by human rights violations limited the amount of land under cultivation, resulting in deepening food insecurity. About 1.7 million people were internally displaced and living in precarious conditions in camps or with host communities. During the lean season from June to September 2017, about 3.7 million people were expected to face critical levels of food insecurity. The lack of basic shelter, water, latrines and shower facilities increased the risks of communicable diseases including cholera and exacerbated malnutrition among children under age 5. While the number of people in need had increased by 23 per cent from 2016 and one of the key strategic priorities in 2017 was to scale up humanitarian assistance, the 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan was only 42 per cent funded at mid-year.

"Between April and June 2018, inter-communal violence along the border areas of Gedeo (Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region) and West Guji (Oromia) zones led to the displacement of over 800,000 people and worsened the ongoing food and nutrition insecurity situation in the region. Although general food assistance was provided by the Government and international and national agencies, the scale of displacement meant that needs exceeded response capacity.

Of the nine deaths registered, five cases were pneumonic and four bubonic. The disease is endemic in Madagascar and the number of cases was within the annual averages and still manageable. However, there was concern that due to aggravating factors such an ongoing measles outbreak, the occurrence of cases near populated urban areas, and presidential campaign activities which presented opportunities for crowds could increase the risk of spreading the disease.

Between late March and June, more than 300,000 people were displaced, mainly in central and southern Somalia. The damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, and lack of adequate shelter made the affected population particularly susceptible to disease outbreaks. This was compounded by pre-existing vulnerabilities as the majority of communities in the affected regions were already facing an acute food security crisis – including as a result of months of intense drought that directly preceded the floods. It was anticipated, following reports from humanitarian partners and ongoing needs assessments, that the affected population would remain extremely vulnerable through September 2018 if humanitarian assistance were not rapidly scaled up; provision of food assistance, health services to mitigate disease outbreaks, shelter and other core relief items, and water and sanitation services were identified as priority needs.",Report Available,593,2018,18-RR-SOM-30443,74,Somalia,SOM,3,Rapid Response,6,Flood,Natural Disaster,Somalia RR Application May 2018 (Floods),3,Biological (human disease outbreak and other health emergency),1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,630000,UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,5133588,2018-05-18,2018-05-22,Summary will be available soon.

"A significant influx of refugees from the Central African Republic (CAR) entered Chad following clashes and atrocities against civilians in north-west CAR in December 2017. Approximately 20,000 refugees arrived in Chad in March 2017, with subsequent waves following. As of 2018, continued violence and insecurity in CAR meant continued waves of refugees were expected to arrive, while those in the country were not expected to be able to return to Chad in the immediate future. These refugees arrived in Chad traumatized and with considerable protection and humanitarian needs. Most refugees were hosted by communities near the border where both host community members and refugees had limited access to food and basic social services such as health, education and access to water. Assessments indicated food security was of particular concern requiring emergency agricultural support. Difficulties in accessing drinking water was also reported in all refugee reception areas due to the lack of water infrastructure, raising health risks such as diarrhoea.

"Since March 2017, over 35,000 Congolese refugees have fled violence and taken refuge in Angola. The escalation of violence in Kasai DRC triggered the internal displacement of some 1.4 million people and the influx of over 35,000 refugees into Angola. As of 20 August 2018, the number of registered refugees in Angola was 35,837. The total refugee active population (population receiving food assistance) was 22,624.

"Sudan remained one of the world’s largest protracted humanitarian crises with 5.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in 2018; this number includes nearly two million Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), 1.2 million refugees, approximately 386,000 returnees, and 2.3 million children suffering from malnutrition. Due to reduced hostilities and intercommunal violence, 17,000 new IDPs were reported in 2017 in comparison to approximately 172,000 in 2016. In 2018, sporadic clashes in the Jebel Marra have displaced at least 22,000 people. Fighting in East Jebel Marra had also reportedly displaced people and several villages have been affected, with lack of access preventing verification of the total number. In addition, at least 2 million people remained displaced in the Sudan, with many living in camps for over a decade in Darfur. According to the Government, an estimated 386,000 IDPs and refugees returned to their homes. As of 31 July 2018, there were 147,671 South Sudanese refugees living across eight camps in White Nile. Results from the Standardized Expanded Nutrition Survey (SENS) for refugee camps in White Nile State, released at the end of June 2018, indicated malnutrition above emergency levels. The key drivers of malnutrition include ongoing food insecurity due to pipeline breaks and the sale of food, as well as low nutrition programme enrolment and nutrition treatment adherence. In addition, the findings point to the wider effects of chronic underfunding for the response (currently about 10% funded), especially for WASH, health and livelihoods assistance. WFP has reported refugees selling their food in order to access basic services such as water, medicine, school uniforms and cooking fuel – a coping strategy to compensate for service provision gaps in other sectors, which has intensified food insecurity.",Report Available,620,2018,18-UF-SDN-32210,76,Republic of the Sudan,SDN,2,Underfunded Emergencies,19,Post-conflict Needs,Conflict-related,Sudan UF Application Sep 2018 (food insecurity and malnutrition),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,3,Northern Africa,3,Northern Africa,1,Africa,5500000,FAO;IOM;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,19997876,2018-10-04,2018-10-15,Summary will be available soon.
"Food insecurity was greatly compounded in Southern Chad in 2017/2018 following poor harvests due to lower than average rainfall throughout the Sahel. This was particularly acute in Southern Chad and compounded by crises caused by pests, such as locusts, cantharides, grain-eating birds and caterpillars. Official agricultural statics indicate that cereal production decreased by 5 per cent compared to the 2016/2017 period. Eight departments were found to have majority of residents in IPC-phase 3. This means having food consumption gaps that are reflected by high or above-usual acute malnutrition or being marginally able to meet minimum food needs but only by depleting essential livelihood assets or through crisis-coping strategies. A September 2017 Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transition indicated national rates of mild acute malnutrition of 13.9, slightly below the critical threshold set by WHO. According to forecast data, 167,253 children would have been affected by severe malnutrition in these regions in 2018. Rates were particularly high in 15 priority regions that cross the WHO emergency threshold of two per cent. A total of 56,439 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition were admitted to care centres compared to 34,464 expected during the first quarter of 2018 in these regions, an increase of 64 per cent.

"In July 2018, the Libya’s Ministry of Health declared a measles outbreak. There was increasing concern to prevent further escalation of the outbreak, already in its 38th week, under which 591 cases were reported.  Prolonged conflict and lack of resources had made the population vulnerable to health shocks and epidemics and reduced response capacity. While the country was a high-middle income country before 2011, by 2018 17.5 per cent of public hospitals and 20 per cent of primary health care facilities in Libya were damaged and non-functional. Essential equipment, trained personnel and medicines were also severely lacking. Only 10 per cent of public health centres and 40 per cent of hospitals offered basic services. Only 1,897 of 4,275 official posts were filled and there were gaps of 4,997 nurses and 359 midwives. Vulnerability to health risks was heightened by malnutrition. In 2014, 6.5 per cent of children under age 5 were acutely malnourished (about 6,000 children), 3 per cent (200 children) severely acutely malnourished. Assessments further indicated that 21 per cent of children under 5 years of age (18,000 children), suffered from chronic malnutrition or stunting. Compounding this was increased migration of vulnerable groups. While Libya has traditionally been a migratory crossroads, mixed migration, including “children on the move”, asylum seekers, economic migrants, unaccompanied and separated children, environmental migrants, victims of trafficking and stranded migrants, increased by 33 per cent since 2014. By May 2019 there were an estimated 641,398 migrants in Libya, including almost 58,000 children, 20,000 of whom were separated or unaccompanied.

"The humanitarian situation in Libya was heavily impacted by the political upheaval of 2011 and the social and economic consequences - including the disintegration of the country into territories where various political and military entities exercise authority. In 2018, when this CERF grant was provided, there were an estimated 1,400 militias in the country, with various fiefdoms where they controlled, among other things, access to basic services. The consequence of this division was an uneven availability of essential services to large segments of the population. Economically, a black market evolved where the Libyan Dinar was sometimes traded at levels that were three times higher than the official rate, leading to a cash liquidity crisis that had a very negative impact on Libyan’s ability to pay for services such as health care and education.

The root causes of the situation were armed conflict, the resulting displacement, the over-burdening of limited and generally deficient services in receiving host communities, lawlessness, human rights violations, uncontrolled migration, economic collapse, the deterioration of basic services (water, sanitation, health, cash liquidity, and markets) and political deadlock.

The agencies included in the CERF application (WASH and Health especially) were severely under-funded. For example, the protection sector - considered one of the most vital for the humanitarian response - was only 13 percent funded.

"The humanitarian situation in Mali deteriorated considerably in the first months of 2018. The population of 18.9 million people already faced significant vulnerabilities following several years of shocks. This was compounded by lower than average rainfalls and agricultural yields, escalating violence and operations to combat violent extremism, and displacement following insecurity and inter-community violence. More than 61,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), more than 64,000 returnees, and nearly 650,000 returnees were in need of humanitarian assistance in the areas of return or displacement in the northern and central regions of Mali.  Assessments of March 2018 showed a significant deterioration in food and nutritional security of households with the number of people in need of assistance having increased by more than 1 million people between the 2017 and 2018 lean season. Food insecurity was a particular concern with the number of people in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification phase 3 or 4 (“crisis” and “emergency” situation respectively) having doubled compared to the previous year. According to these projections, 932,651 people would have needed immediate assistance during the upcoming (June to September) agricultural lean season.

The cases, coming from the same family, reportedly had an onset of symptoms in Jibiya LGA before seeking treatment on 5 July 2018 at a health facility in a bordering town in Niger. Vibrio cholerae O1 Inaba was confirmed in stool samples from all three cases.

These areas were among the most affected districts during previous outbreaks with the last major outbreak reported in Niger in 2014 involving more than 2,000 cases. These areas were classified as high-risk areas for the spread of cholera given the presence of local risk factors such as poor hygiene and sanitary conditions coupled with large volumes of population movements and trade between these districts and neighbouring areas in Nigeria.

"The Tillabery and Tahoua regions of Niger, on the border with Mali, have seen a progressive deterioration of the security situation since January 2018, resulting in significant waves of forced migration. The security situation was becoming increasingly volatile.  Non-state armed groups were increasing attacks and threats against civilians, leading to increasing displacement. Reports also indicated that cross-border military operations targeting these groups were contributing to an increased incidence of violence against civilians and displacement as armed groups moved across borders to evade military operations and hid among civilian populations, perpetrating violence against them. In addition, intercommunal violence among pastoralists, over cattle, land and water, was also intensifying and contributing to further destabilization of the region, leading to at least 276 reported killings. The two conflicts became intertwined as members of these communities joined non-state armed groups for protection and better access to resources. As a result of the growing insecurity, the number of refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) in need of protection, water and sanitation, shelter and food assistance rose sharply. The number of displaced in Tillabery alone increased from 540 to 17,758, far exceeding the resources and capacities of the authorities and host communities.

"The migration from Venezuelans over recent years has been the largest in the modern history of Latin America and the Caribbean. The economic and political crisis – characterized by hyperinflation, low purchasing power and a severely limited access to basic goods and services – has generated a great number of refugees migrating to several countries in Latin America, principally to neighboring Colombia. By November 2018 more than a million Venezuelan nationals were living in Colombia, according to official figures. This rose to 1.2 million by February 2019 and was expected to reach 2 million by the end of 2019. In addition, authorities estimated over 500,000 Colombians returned to the country; this figure likely underestimates the number as the proportion of unregistered migrants is significant. These arrivals face insecurity and have significant protection and humanitarian needs. Inter-agency assessments found critical humanitarian needs in the border areas for lifesaving activities in the sectors of health, food assistance, water and sanitation, education, protection and shelter. At least four categories of population were affected each presenting specific vulnerabilities and needs: Venezuelan families coming to live in Colombia or to transit south America bound; Colombian returnees or mixed families; indigenous groups that inhabit ancestral territories, on both sides of the border; and Colombian host-communities. Joint assessments carried out by IOM, UNHCR and WFP found significant needs in health nutrition, protection, water and sanitation sectors. In the area 75 per cent of Colombian-Venezuelan families, 66 per cent of Venezuelans families and 42 per cent of Colombian returnees lacked access to health care. More than 90 per cent of infants and children under 2 years of age were not breastfeeding, as 98 per cent of breastfeeding women were not receiving food supplements. Around 46 per cent of households interviewed do not have access to sanitation and water supply systems. More than one third of the households do not have access to formal education. The security situation in the border regions where Venezuelans and Colombian returnees arrive remained impacted by the conflicts in Colombia, presenting additional protection concerns.

Colombia and Peru are still the main destination for Venezuelans, Ecuador is increasingly becoming a destination country, apart from the main hub for transit of Venezuelans aiming to reach Peru or countries further south. According to Ecuadorian migration authorities, in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 more than 1,135,000 Venezuelans had arrived in Ecuador with an estimated 30 per cent staying there. In response, the Government of Ecuador declared a State of Emergency in several border provinces.  
Rumichaca, one of two main border crossings, received the largest part of the population, with between 2,500 and 3,500 people arriving each day. The capacity of border officials to process the arrivals were strained, as well as local capacities to provide needed services and humanitarian services. Many Venezuelans were forced to stay at border crossings or in bus terminals for days on end on their way South, lacking information, proper shelter, needing food, medical assistance, relief items and facing various protection concerns including trafficking, robbery and sexual or labor exploitation.

"Venezuela’s political, social and economic situation has deteriorated over the last two years. The economic crisis is leading to triple digit monthly hyperinflation. Moreover, the loss of oil revenue and imposed economic sanctions have resulted in import reductions that are causing shortages of medical, food and other basic supplies. Production capacities have decreased in most economically productive industries and there is serious disruption of basic services (mainly electricity, water and transport), as a result, the population is facing severe challenges related to health, nutrition and protection.

A CERF allocation was needed to alleviate negative consequences of the crisis for the most vulnerable population. The main CERF activities were to contain the nutritional deterioration and to reduce its impact particularly on infants, pregnant and lactating women; to help ensure access to treatment and continuity of priority health programs; and to strengthen pre-existing protection networks.

This is the sixth allocation to the Venezuela mixed migratory crisis in 2018. Indeed, in response to the increase of the Venezuelan exodus into neighboring countries and beyond, the ERC allocated up to  $5.9 million to Colombia, $1.5 million to Brazil, $1.5 million to Ecuador, and $2 million to Peru.

"In 2018, the situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) was impacted by a protracted humanitarian crisis, including limited access to basic life-saving services, food insecurity and undernutrition. In this context, humanitarian agencies’ ability to the population’s humanitarian needs was severely hampered by a sharp decline in funding, placing the lives of the most vulnerable further a risk. 
 
In the realm of health, disease was major concerns. Much of the country lacked sufficient health facilities and essential medical equipment or medicines to provide quality health services. There were disparities in access to services between rural and urban areas, demonstrated by under-five mortality rates, which were 1.2 times higher in rural areas than urban areas. The country had one of the highest rates of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in the world. The withdrawal of funds by the Global Fund for the treatment of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis left a critical gap in the country with only 2,400 out of 4,600 new cases receiving treatment. While the funding from the Global Fund provided earlier in 2018 allowed the procurement of drugs to treat ‘normal’ TB, there was a major gap in funds for the provision of treatment for MDR TB, which is more serious, more complicated and more expensive to treat. 
 
Chronic and widespread malnutrition and inadequate water, health and sanitation compounded health related issues. According to the 2017 Global Hunger Index, DPRK has a score of 28.2, which is classified as ‘serious’. Around 10.3 million people, or 41 per cent of the total population, are undernourished. An estimated 20 per cent of children are stunted and 3 per cent suffer from wasting. According to the 2017 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, almost 40 per cent of households are drinking contaminated water. 
 
Due to lack of financing or humanitarian activities in the DPRK, agencies had been forced to scale down life-saving activities, with detrimental impacts for the most vulnerable people.

"Afghanistan was hit by severe drought in 2018 that devastated the agricultural sector in the already vulnerable provinces, leaving 9.9 million people were food insecure. The Government of Afghanistan declared a drought in mid-April of 2018 and requested the international community’s support. Satellite imagery showed far lower levels of vegetation density, crop failure and uncultivated land. The drought exacerbated existing vulnerabilities. As of late 2017, most of the drought affected areas were already at or beyond integrated food security phase classification (IPC) 3, meaning the population had food consumption gaps reflected by high or above-usual acute malnutrition or were only marginally able to meet minimum food needs. Nutritional status of affected communities worsened following the drought. A total 482,000 children aged 6-59 months were reported with acute malnutrition (severe and moderate acute malnutrition) in 20 drought affected provinces from July to December 2018. This included 147,076 with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and 334,924 with Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM). In addition, the situation of water supply and sanitation in Afghanistan is among the worst in the world with more than 36 per cent of Afghans without access to an improved safe water source and 47 per cent still using unimproved sanitation facilities.

"Millions of people have suffered humanitarian consequences since the start of the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine in 2014. Despite numerous ceasefire agreements, civilians are regularly exposed to active hostilities, particularly along the 427-kilometre “contact line” that divides the Government Controlled Area and Non-Government Controlled Area of eastern Ukraine (NGCA). As of 2018, over 3,000 civilians have been killed and approximately 9,000 injured since the start of the conflict. The cumulative impact of severe restrictions on the movement, active hostilities and limited humanitarian access have resulted in 2.2 million people, over half a million of whom are elderly, in dire need of humanitarian assistance, including protection and core relief items. The hostilities have also damaged and destroyed homes, hospitals, schools, roads, water supply systems and other civilian infrastructure, severely limiting the affected population’s access to critical basic services and life-saving activities such as education, health, water and other utilities. Assessments conducted in 2018 indicated a total of 2.2 million people needed humanitarian assistance in the NGCA. This included 300,000 school-aged children without access to education, 1.4 million people without reliable access to safe drinking water, and the population impacted by a fragmented and weakened healthcare system.

"The humanitarian crisis in Yemen remains the worst in the world. Conflict and severe economic decline since 2014 are driving the country to the brink of famine and increasing humanitarian suffering. Since November 2017, the blockade on air and seaports and the escalation of the conflict on Yemen’s western coast have led to increased humanitarian needs in all sectors. In early 2018, the Yemen Humanitarian Needs Overview indicated an estimated 80 per cent of the population – some 22.2 million people – require some form of humanitarian or protection assistance, including 11.3 million who are in acute need. About 12.9 million people needed assistance to protect their safety, dignity or basic rights, from violations of international humanitarian law, grave violations of children’s rights or gender-based violence. Some 2.6 million new internally displaced people (IDPs) currently needed shelter, while an estimated 14.1 million children were out of school due to the conflict. Around 17.8 million people were classified as food insecure, of whom 8.4 million were severely food insecure, 1.2 million pregnant and lactating women were at risk of acute malnutrition and 1.8 million children were acutely malnourished, including 400,000 children under age of 5 years suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Some 16 million people lacked adequate access to clean water and sanitation.

"The 2018 drought – a result of the La Niña phenomenon associated with reduced rain and snowfall levels left more than 9.9 million people food insecure. The situation of water supply and sanitation in Afghanistan I sone of the poorest in the world with more than 36 per cent of the population living without access to improved safe water sources and 47 per cent still using unimproved sanitation facilities. Afghanistan has had the highest number of recorded landmine and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) casualties for two years running. In 2018, approximately 120 people per month were killed or injured by landmines, ERW and/or landmines of an improvised nature, also known as Victim Operated Improvised Explosive Devices, pressure-plate improvised explosive devices. According to the 2018 Protection Analysis of Conflict Affected Populations (PACAP) report, 52 per cent of displaced households indicated the presence of explosive hazards in their places of origin. Roughly 46 per cent of displaced households in the south of Afghanistan reported encounters with explosive hazards during displacement, either on the move or at displacement locations. Further, UNMAS Afghanistan recorded a total of 10,957 mine action casualties from 2011 until July 2019. Twenty-four per cent of these casualties occurred in the five provinces selected for this intervention: Kunduz, Baghlan, Uruzgan, Helmand and Nangarhar; 50 per cent of these casualties were children. According to UNMAS data, mine action casualties in the five provinces were caused by landmines of an improvised nature 57 per cent of the time and ERW 40 per cent of the time.   Afghanistan’s under-developed health system is thinly spread across the country, due to ongoing conflict and insecurity, as well as infrastructure challenges. Around 30 per cent of the population has limited access to basic health services within a 2-hour travel radius and maternal mortality is among the highest in the world. Only 50 per cent of children under five have received the full suite of recommended vaccinations to keep them safe and healthy. The fragile health system is further overburdened by mass casualty incidents and recurrent outbreaks of communicable diseases, especially among IDPs. It is anticipated that 50 per cent of people in Afghanistan are suffering from some form of psychological distress and some 20 per cent of the population is impaired in his or her role due to mental health issues. Traditional barriers hinder many from having mental disorders diagnosed and from seeking appropriate services. There is also limited mental health training among health personnel leaving many sufferers to live with their conditions without support.The nutritional situation in Afghanistan continued to be alarming. Ongoing conflict, low access to basic services, and the impact of natural disasters have exacerbated the already existing vulnerabilities of communities, contributing towards high rates of acute malnutrition. According to the nutrition surveys in 2019, 22 out of 34 provinces were above the emergency level threshold of acute malnutrition based on WHO classification of wasting rates for children under the age of five (global acute malnutrition (GAM) ≥10 per cent with aggravating factors). The impact of drought in 2018 which extended through 2019, further aggravated the poor nutritional situation.

Overall, the EFSA’s results estimated that around 36% of the Guatemalan population were suffering moderate to severe food insecurity which, considering rural poverty as a crucial factor of vulnerability, has resulted in around 3 million people subject to food insecurity. The four states with the highest food insecurity levels were Alta Verapaz (80.5%), Quiché (58.1%), Quetzaltenango (58%) and Sololá (54%).


The food insecurity situation was a result of an extended dry spell, lasting up to 50 days at a time, which happened in the middle of the rainy season of 2018. That resulted in harvest losses up to 75% for maize and beans affecting around 300,000 households. Alternative income sources for affected family members were not available since labour for coffee and cardamom harvests was limited.

In Alta Verapaz, 800,000 people (160,000 families) were identified to be in-need of food assistance, including around 225,000 children under 5. According to data from the Ministry of Health, 47 children died in 2018 due to complications related to severe acute malnutrition. The Nutrition Cluster identified 7 municipalities with the highest levels of acute malnutrition, between 3.0 and 4.5%, with 16,500 children under 5 suffering severe acute malnutrition. Around 5,500 families were in immediate need for life-saving humanitarian response.",Report Available,677,2019,19-RR-GTM-37683,38,Guatemala,GTM,3,Rapid Response,8,Drought,Natural Disaster,Guatemala RR Application Jun 2019 (Drought),3,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",1,Natural Disaster,6,Latin America and the Caribbean,8,Central America,2,Americas,3000000,FAO;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,1986599,2019-07-03,2019-07-03,Summary will be available soon.
"According to the Salvadoran Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN), from 2012 to 2015 El Salvador suffered four consecutive droughts that generated agricultural losses up to $218.8 million. 2016 and 2017 were years of partial recovery for smallholder farmers. However, in 2018 El Salvador experienced the longest dry period for 48 years and this occurred at the most critical phase of the first crop cycle. This was followed by extremely heavy rains during the second and last crop cycle that further exacerbated the situation. Consequently, the General Directorate of Civil Protection issued an orange alert for 12 departments and red alert for 143 municipalities due to extreme weather drought. In response to the severe drought and declaration of Red Alerts, the government activated its national response mechanisms and immediately requested WFP, FAO and UNICEF to carry out an Emergency Food Security Assessment (EFSA). The results revealed that 98,783 subsistence farmers’ households (493,915 people) were heavily affected by the drought, of which 85% are completely dependent on agricultural activities. The assessment highlighted that 42,000 families (210,000 people) would be food insecure as of January 2019, month in which it was estimated that their food reserves would be exhausted and require urgent assistance. In addition, the analysis of the Integrated Classification by Phases of Food Security (IPC) projected that from April to July 2019, 5% (63,000 people) of the affected population will be in the emergency phase, 17% (239,000 people) in crisis phase and 34% (472,000 people) in stress phase.",Report Available,678,2019,19-RR-SLV-37678,32,El Salvador,SLV,3,Rapid Response,8,Drought,Natural Disaster,El Salvador RR Application Jun 2019 (Drought),3,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",1,Natural Disaster,6,Latin America and the Caribbean,8,Central America,2,Americas,3900000,FAO;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,1998859,2019-07-11,2019-07-11,Summary will be available soon.
"After the request for CERF funds made in August 2019, the political and economic crisis in Venezuela continued to deepen, with serious humanitarian consequences for its population. As noted in the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview and in the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan with Humanitarian Needs Overview, the humanitarian situation in Venezuela is the result of seven consecutive years of economic contraction, episodes of hyperinflation, political polarization and institutional challenges. Official figures from the Central Bank of Venezuela in 2020 indicate an economic contraction of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of more than 53 per cent in the last six years. Household income, savings and consumption all declined. Public spending, including significant investment in social programmes and the ability to import and market goods and ensure essential services, have also been affected. While the Government has made efforts to maintain social protection programmes, the situation has negatively impacted the living conditions of the most vulnerable people, particularly in terms of their access to food, medicines and medical treatment. The functionality of infrastructure and essential services including water, electricity, domestic gas, fuel and transport was been affected. In addition, and as a coping mechanism, the situation led to considerable human mobility as people search for better living conditions and access to basic services and/or protection. People are moving both internally towards border, mining and urban areas, as well as to other countries.

Over 7 million people were estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance. More than 21 per cent of the population – some 6.8 million people – were estimated to be suffering from undernourishment. Some 2.4 million were estimated to be severely food insecure. Communicable diseases such as measles and malaria have resurfaced. School dropouts were estimated to affect more than 856,000 children and adolescents. Many families resorting to negative coping mechanisms such as selling assets, taking children out of school to contribute to family income, or leaving children behind when migrating to other countries. The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated pre-existing humanitarian needs and has impacted the provision of essential services like healthcare and water, gas and electricity supply. The most vulnerable groups identified included the indigenous population, pregnant and lactating women, vulnerable women heads of household, people with disability, elderly people, children at risk, people on the move, and people with communicable and non-communicable diseases with limited access to medicines.",Report Available,695,2019,19-UF-VEN-38565,147,Venezuela,VEN,2,Underfunded Emergencies,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,Venezuela UF Application Sep 2019 (Multiple),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,6,Latin America and the Caribbean,8,Central America,2,Americas,7000000,UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WHO,10015686,2019-09-27,2019-10-03,Summary will be available soon.

"Honduras has been facing chronic drought and prolonged dry spells for five consecutive years, a situation which further exacerbated by El Niño. The humanitarian situation along Honduras’ dry corridor reached crisis levels in August 2018, with more than 850,000 people facing food insecurity and requiring humanitarian assistance. The production losses of basic grains in the first 2018 cycle was greater than 70 per cent for more than half of the producers in the Dry Corridor, with more than 75 per cent of households losing their food reserves. A food security assessment carried out late in 2018 identified 525,000 people affected by various levels of food insecurity and with 40 per cent of households having a decreased quantity of water compared to the same time of the year in 2017. These factors place people at risk of water-borne diseases. After the Honduran Council of Ministers declared a state of emergency in 12 departments, the Government, with the support of the Humanitarian Country Team, developed an action plan to respond to the immediate needs of 65,500 food insecure households in 74 municipalities of Honduras over a 6-month period.

"After five decades of armed conflict including over 220,000 casualties and four years of peace talks between the Government of Colombia and the FARC-EP guerrillas, a peace accord was signed in November 2016, which was expected to translate in some humanitarian relief in many areas of the country. Nonetheless, the limited extension of state authority in areas left by the FARC has encouraged territorial disputes between non-state armed groups that seek to control areas with a presence of illicit crop cultivation and which serve as logistical corridors for trafficking. In addition, the humanitarian impact of persistent armed actions, natural disasters and challenges in access to basic goods and services by vulnerable segments of the population, have coincided with increasing numbers of Venezuelan migrants and refugees arriving to many areas of the country. 
Other humanitarian impacts included natural disasters, which affected 330,000 people in 2018, combined with an El Niño phenomenon in late 2018 and early 2019.

"The humanitarian situation in the Venezuela was deteriorating, resulting in the displacement of over 5 million migrants and refugees since 2015. Political and socioeconomic instability in Venezuela had contributed to widespread unemployment, reports of human rights violations, growing insecurity and challenges in ensuring access to basic commodities, such as food and medicine, forcing a large number of Venezuelans to leave their country. Migrants and refugees from Venezuela moved into surrounding countries, stretching capacities of host governments, particularly in border areas with high populations of Venezuelans, and increased pressure on already overburdened local services. According to August 2019 figures, 1,408,055 Venezuelan migrants and refugees were hosted in Colombia , 853,429 in Peru ,  330,414 in Ecuador, and 178,575 in Brazil. The pressure on limited resources has resulted in a rise in xenophobia, generating more frequent incidents aimed at foreigners.  According to IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) reports, children (25.5 per cent of the surveyed population), pregnant women (6.4 per cent of the surveyed population), the elderly (0.9 per cent of the surveyed population), as well as people with chronic diseases or disabilities (9 per cent of the surveyed population) were among the most vulnerable. In addition, UNHCR has noted high levels of unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) among the Venezuelan migrant and refugee population. Through the DTM and local assessment as well as coordination with stakeholders, IOM and UNHCR identified the following needs a) large concentrations of Venezuelans at border points and in other receiving areas with poor reception conditions increased the vulnerabilities of people on the move; b) public structures and resources at the local level in recipient countries became insufficient to cope with the immediate protection, shelter, food and non-food items (NFI) needs; c) the capacities of the migration and asylum authorities to manage the high demand for documentation and regular status was overstretched, including instances of statelessness due to a lack of jus soli when Venezuelan children are born d) individuals and families arrived in extremely vulnerable conditions and with significantly reduced resilience and self-sufficiency; e) as a result, partially of the aforementioned points but also of stricter legislation, the intensified use of unsafe land routes poses increasing threats to the life and dignity including smuggling, Trafficking in Persons (TiP), Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV),  child protection risks including child labour, begging, sexual exploitation, recruitment by criminal gangs, involvement in illegal activities and early marriage and LGBTI risks and vulnerabilities of Venezuelans on the move.  The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic added yet another layer to the challenges faced by Venezuela and neighboring countries. As COVID-19 cases rapidly spread through the region, many countries imposed strict lockdown measures, including restriction of movement and curfews; many migrants and refugees lost their sources of income and were unable to secure money for food, housing, and health care. The regional interagency coordination platform (R4V), co-led by IOM and UNHCR, launched a revised version of the Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan 2020 (RMRP), adapted to the changing landscape following COVID-19. In order to address new challenges in provision of protection and basic support, the updated RMRP, which involves over 151 organizations engaged in the Venezuela response, estimated the financial requirements to USD1.41 billion for a target of 4.11 million people.",Report Available,693,2019,19-UF-VZR-38575,267,Venezuela Regional Refugee and Migration Crisis,VZR,2,Underfunded Emergencies,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,VZ Region UF Application Sep 2019 (Venezuela regional emergency),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,6,Latin America and the Caribbean,9,South America,2,Americas,4300000,IOM;UNHCR,6000000,2019-09-25,2019-10-03,Summary will be available soon.
"In 2019, Haiti was affected by drought which led to a significant decline in agricultural production and loss of income for rural households. Throughout 2018, Haiti experienced a rapidly deteriorating political and economic situation, which took a turn for the worse in 2019, severely reducing the average income and purchasing power of Haitian households, especially the most vulnerable. Civil unrest continued throughout 2019, with increasing levels of violence, impacting public and private provision of essential services. In addition, Haiti is highly vulnerable to climate shocks.  Haiti was identified by the 2019 Climate Risk Index as the fourth most affected country by climate events in the period 1998-2017. In 2019, the rainfall deficit led to a new year of drought and the further deterioration of living standards for the most vulnerable people, particularly those whose livelihoods were linked to agriculture. In this context, the country experienced drought 2018, which led to a significant decline in agricultural production and loss of income for rural households. This contributed to increased food insecurity and malnutrition among already vulnerable communities. The October 2019 Food Security Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) exercise found that during the hunger gap period of March-June 2019, 2.6 million Haitians living in rural areas were reported to be food insecure (IPC phases 3 and 4), representing about 38 per cent of the rural population. 1.05 million people were in the emergency phase 4 (of which 207,000 in urban settings) and 2.63 million in the crisis phase 3 (of which 649,000 in urban settings).

"The cholera epidemic started in Haiti in 2010, resulting in a significant humanitarian and health crisis, with over 800,000 suspected cases and over 9,700 deaths reported between 2010 and 2018. In 2013, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population developed and implemented the National Plan for the Elimination of Cholera, supported by UN humanitarian agencies and partners – with the overall goal of ending the epidemic by 2022. Thanks to a strategy of surveillance, rapid response, coordination and community engagement, the epidemic was on a downward trend, despite some short but localized outbreaks. Since 2016, the annual number of suspected cases and deaths had been steadily declining. The objectives of the medium-term phase of the plan were attained by 2018 with an annual incidence of cholera of 0.03 per cent – below the plan’s objective of less than 0.1 per cent. In 2018, only 3,786 suspected cases and 41 deaths were reported:  a respective decrease of 72 per cent and 74 per cent since the peak of the epidemic in 2011, and the lowest annual incidence since the start of the epidemic. The situation continued to improve, and by early February 2019 ‘zero confirmed cases’ was achieved. However, despite the overall decrease in cases, localized outbreaks continued to be reported in several areas of cholera persistence. Risks remained as a result of surveillance gaps and cross-border cholera cases.

"In 2019, Haiti faced a serious humanitarian situation as a result of both chronic and acute factors. The country has suffered the impact of several major natural disasters over the past decades and faces profound and multi-dimensional poverty, ranking 169th of 189 countries on the 2019 Human Development Index, with one quarter of its population living below the extreme poverty line. Levels of chronic food insecurity are among the highest in the world, with more than half of the population of 10.9 million chronically food insecure. This was exacerbated further by the El Niño phenomenon in the first half of 2019, which created a drought and a 12.3 per cent drop in agricultural production, and the ongoing political crisis and civil unrest, both of which significantly decreased food availability. The October 2019 Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) exercise showed a significant deterioration of the food security and nutritional situation of rural and urban households in the country, with 3.7 million people facing acute food insecurity with 1 million people facing emergency levels of food insecurity between the months of October 2019 and February 2020. From March to June 2020, the number of people facing acute food insecurity was projected to increase to 4.1 million, including an estimated 1.2 million people likely to face emergency levels of food insecurity. A February 2020 survey showed increases in national rates of malnutrition for children rising above emergency thresholds: with national rates of global acute malnutrition rates rising to 6 per cent, national rates of Moderate Acute Malnutrition 3.9 per cent, and national rates of Severe Acute Malnutrition to 2.1 per cent. In September 2019, a phase of almost complete lockdown of the country started due to civil unrest, which hampered or halted humanitarian operations while humanitarian needs increased.

In 2019 insecurity and armed violence severely continued to disrupt basic social services and national development efforts, severely impacting the civilian population. The humanitarian situation in Diffa was particularly acute, where the Lake Chad Basin crisis and attacks by Boko Haram and clashes with the Nigerian national army led to the displacement of millions. The region has been under a state of emergency since 2015 as a result of violent attacks, looting and threats by non-state armed groups. The situation in Liptako-Gourma, Tahouam and Tillaberi regions also worsened due to the proliferation of non-state armed groups, inter-community conflict and violent extremism. In Tahoua and Tillaberi regions, 13 departments (two in Tahoua and 11 in Tillaberi) have been placed under a state of emergency due to growing insecurity.

"Under the 2019 Libya Humanitarian Relief Plan, humanitarian partners identified 823,000 people to be in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance and protection across Libya and aimed to respond to the most basic needs of the most vulnerable 552,000. The 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview identified that key humanitarian needs in Libya were linked to protection, access to critical services such as health care, education, safe drinking water and sanitation, and access to basic household goods and commodities such as food and essential non-food items. The early part of 2019 saw increasing need as populations were directly and indirectly affected by the resurgence of conflicts in Tripoli and the South, particularly Murzuq, and other locations throughout Libya. However, due to the unpredictable security situation on the ground, humanitarian actors had only limited access to Libya; this became acute when an evacuation status was put in place following an escalation of the conflict. In February 2018, the evacuation order was lifted, giving humanitarian actors a vital opportunity to be consistently present in Libya, and to increase provision of essential services and life-saving protection assistance. Implementation of the Humanitarian Response Plan depended on reliable air services into Libya, which had ceased with evacuation status.

"Significant economic deterioration and price rises in Sudan in 2018 and 2019 had a major humanitarian impact. According to recently published analysis, 5.7 million people were estimated to be in crisis (IPC 3) or emergency (IPC 4) levels of food insecurity in the October-December 2018 period – which was up from 3.8 million for the same period of 2017. Despite a relatively good harvest, these high levels are driven by food prices that have more than doubled in the past year, and the price of the staple crop sorghum is more than 230 per cent above the five-year average. Many people whose levels of food assistance were reduced due to improving livelihoods – including internally displaced people and refugees – were again in need of greater assistance. The crisis continued, with the inflation rate reaching 73 per cent in December 2018 with huge fluctuation in 2019 due to the ongoing political instability and the declaration of state of emergency across the country. This had a direct implication on household nutrition security. Some people adopted negative coping mechanisms. Lack of cash availability also impacted many constructions-related activities or the informal labour market. Vulnerable populations, e.g., internally displaced people and refugees living in urban camps, have been particularly hit as many of them rely on informal markets.  

Beyond food insecurity, the economic crisis had a serious impact on all humanitarian sectors in Sudan. Higher prices for food baskets, which have typically accounted for half of household income, took up more than 65 per cent of household expenditure among internally displaced people and refugees. Households were able to afford less nutritious food, less medical treatment, or fewer agricultural inputs. With fewer resources, negative coping mechanisms like selling of household assets and cutting of trees for charcoal production have increased, with implications for protection risks, particularly gender-based violence. Clinical management of rape is still weak, and the increased potential for gender-based violence and harmful coping strategies of vulnerable communities required immediate attention.",Report Available,650,2019,19-RR-SDN-35023,76,Republic of the Sudan,SDN,3,Rapid Response,35,Economic Disruption,Unspecified Emergency,Sudan RR Application Mar 2019 (economic crisis and food insecurity),5,Conflict-related,0,,3,Northern Africa,3,Northern Africa,1,Africa,5700000,FAO;IOM;UNFPA;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,26362821,2019-04-02,2019-04-16,Summary will be available soon.

Despite the prompt and initial control measures put in place by health and WASH partners under the leadership of the government, it was projected that the outbreak could spread to adjacent localities. According to WHO, close to 23 million people were at risk in the eight states of Sennar, Blue Nile, Gederef, Gezira, Kassala, Khartoum, White Nile and River Nile. In addition, Sudan hosts a significant number of refugees from South Sudan in some of these affected locations which were characterized by an already strained economy as well as limited resources and services, thus, amplifying the risk of further spread of cholera among the refugee communities.

"During the first half of 2019, Sudan’s humanitarian needs have continued to grow. The ongoing economic crisis, at that time, has been exacerbated by months of civil unrest and political uncertainty. Based on revised intersectoral vulnerability analysis, some 8.5 million people are estimated to be in need humanitarian or protection assistance. 
The deepening economic crisis that started in 2018 made more people vulnerable. About 5.8 million people were estimated to be in crisis (IPC 3) or emergency (IPC 4) levels of food insecurity based on March-May 2019 projection – up from 3.8 million at the start of 2018. Despite a relatively good harvest, these high levels of food insecurity were driven by higher production costs and food prices that have more than doubled in 2018. Overall, prices were expected to remain between 30 - 40 per cent above previous year and over 300 per cent above the five-year average. Small-scale farmers were facing increased restrictions, including the availability of, and accessibility to inputs such as machinery, tools, seeds, essential veterinary supplies and feed supplements and fertilizers, due to high and increasing inflation rates. In addition, restricted access to land due to access denial by armed groups and tribal conflict, triggered by political instability, caused a reduction in the planted areas in the Darfur States.

The rainy season underway was predicted to be above normal with floods in several parts of the country such as North and South Darfur increasing the risk of disease outbreaks, including acute watery diarrhoea, particularly in areas where people have limited access to water and sanitation facilities and with limited health infrastructure. 
Protection risks were multiplying. Darfur was of concern due to increased intercommunal tensions and harassment of IDPs including women and girls with GBV continuing to be a major area of concern. Armed tribes were increasingly attacking farmers, including IDPs and intimidating them from farming. Between the June and August 2019 planting season displaced women and girls were at increased risk of sexual violence as they move out of camps to access their farms. Fighting between non-state armed groups was expected to lead to further displacement.

Rising tensions with host communities had introduced new protection concerns for refugees. For example, in June, several host community attacks on South Sudanese refugees in Khartoum led to the new displacement of about 7,000 refugees who were forced to flee their homes, seeking safety in other parts of Khartoum and in refugee camps in White Nile. Host communities were also struggling under the current economic situation and were increasingly disrupting refugee response activities, seeking compensation and assistance support.",Report Available,696,2019,19-UF-SDN-38579,76,Republic of the Sudan,SDN,2,Underfunded Emergencies,27,Multiple Emergencies,Multiple Emergencies,Sudan UF Application Sep 2019 (Economic crisis and food insecurity),6,Internal strife,3,Multiple,3,Northern Africa,3,Northern Africa,1,Africa,8500000,FAO;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,14003594,2019-09-27,2019-11-01,Summary will be available soon.

"Since 2013, the newly independent South Sudan has faced years of internal conflict that has forced almost 4 million people to flee their homes in search of safety, nearly 1.5 million of them within the country and more than 2.2 million outside the country as refugees. At the time of the allocation, communal violence, combined with small-arms proliferation and weak rule of law, were evident. Cattle raiding remains a widespread practice in South Sudan, but one that is increasingly politicized and linked to broader conflict and insecurity. The extended instability in South Sudan has eroded the Government’s ability to provide consistent basic services to its people. At the time of the allocation, a general decrease in fighting led to improved humanitarian access, with movement by road, river and air improving in areas of return. 

As a result of these changes, people in Protection of Civilian sites (PoCs), collective centres, and spontaneous settlements across South Sudan wanted to return to their places of origin. IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) reports that South Sudan saw significant and increasing numbers of returnees in the first three months following the signing of a peace agreement as of September 2018. As of 19 July 2019, at least 534,082 individuals had returned to their places of origin, with the number of returnees per month averaging 96,278 people for both refugee and IDP returnees.

IDP returnees faced significant challenges. Over half of returnees lived in inadequate housing, such as makeshift shelters or partially damaged housing. Many did not have access to land or property. IDP returnee communities included vulnerable groups with specific needs, including children and women at risk, the elderly, people with disabilities, single-headed household members, and the extremely poor. There was a significant need to help IDP returnees integrate into communities of origin, as in the short to medium term their presence created additional pressures on and competition with host communities over food, livelihoods or shelter.

It is estimated that over one million people are internally displaced in the affected areas of DRC and the epicentre of the outbreak is a target for non-state armed actors, resulting in challenges due to insecurity and community resistance.
As of 16 October 2019, about 3,224 EVD cases (link) had been reported in DRC, of which 2,152 died (case fatality ratio 67.1 per cent). The risk of the EVD spreading into the neighbouring countries remains high. In neighbouring states, three cases of Ebola have been confirmed in Uganda as of June 2019 and there are unsubstantiated reports of suspected cases in Tanzania. Also in July, an Ebola case was reported in Ariwara in the DRC, close to the border with South Sudan. 
Based on a WHO joint monitoring mission for EVD preparedness and readiness that took place from 15-19 November 2018, South Sudan was rated as a ‘Priority 1’ country for EVD preparedness and readiness. A coordination and leadership structure was established including (a) a National Task Force (NTF) and State Task Forces (STF) led by the Ministry of Health (MoH); (b) Technical Working Groups (TWG) for selected pillars of the EVD preparedness strategy led by relevant technical partner agencies (noted below); and (c) a Strategic Advisory Group (SAG) led by WHO and constituted by UN agencies, key humanitarian partner agencies and donors. WHO was appointed as Incident Manager to coordinate EVD preparedness activities and provide leadership and guidance to the NTF and SAG.",Report Available,637,2019,19-RR-SSD-33820,91,South Sudan,SSD,3,Rapid Response,30,Ebola,Disease Outbreak,South Sudan RR Application Jan 2019 (Ebola readiness),2,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",0,,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,435344,IOM;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,2015164,2019-01-25,2019-01-25,Summary will be available soon.
"On 1 August 2018, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) declared an Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu Province. As of 8 January 2019, 628 Ebola cases (580 confirmed, 48 probable) with 383 deaths had been reported. The outbreak affects provinces and villages in between 30 and 100 kilometres from the Uganda/DRC border. The risk of the disease spreading beyond the border of the DRC into Uganda was assessed by WHO as very high due to Uganda’s proximity to the epicentres of the outbreak, the high-volume of cross-border movements between DRC Ebola-affected provinces and Uganda, and the influx of Congolese refugees to Uganda due to continued unpredictable security situation in North Kivu and Ituri provinces  affected by the outbreak. The Government of Uganda responded swiftly to the threat by strengthening preparedness and readiness actions. The Ministry of Health activated the National Task Force for Ebola and revised the Uganda Ebola Preparedness and Response Plan.

"Uganda hosted the largest refugee population in Africa, with over 1.2 million refugees as of December 2018. Existing refugee populations and continuing new arrivals put enormous pressure on the country’s resources. Acute needs remained in protection, food assistance, shelter, health and nutrition, WASH and emergency livelihoods. Deteriorating security, political instability, gross human rights abuses and protection concerns in neighboring countries drove people to seek safety and security in Uganda throughout 2019, with 155,000 new arrivals expected in 2019, the majority from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Humanitarian partners have been overstretched and resources have not been sufficiently able to meet the scale of need in some sites, causing a deterioration in existing refugee and hosting community settlements. Communities shared limited resources and struggled to cope with additional new daily arrivals. This came against the backdrop of the fact that the refugee hosting districts were among the poorest districts in Uganda. Despite these humanitarian challenges, the 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan, established to respond to the needs of the Refugees and target host communities, remained critically underfunded at 57 per cent.",Report Available,658,2019,19-UF-UGA-35202,83,Uganda,UGA,2,Underfunded Emergencies,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,Uganda UF Application Mar 2019 (Displacement),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,1223033,FAO;IOM;UN Women;UNDP;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,17991573,2019-04-25,2019-05-16,Summary will be available soon.

"In 2019 Tanzania faced significant humanitarian needs as a result of a large refugee population, which was compounded by chronic levels of underfunding. As of the beginning of 2019, Tanzania was host to over 328,083 refugees and asylum-seekers. The great majority resided in three camps in the country’s north-western region bordering Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Refugee inflows to Tanzania continued to increase as a result of unresolved political situations in both countries. Refugees and asylum-seekers faced difficult circumstances in Tanzania. They were entirely dependent on humanitarian assistance; there were also concerns over potential conflict between host and refugee communities in Kigoma over limited resources such as water, food and firewood. Limited resources, combined with recent restrictions on economic activities in the camps, have had a dramatic effect on livelihoods of both refugees and host communities.

"Following a below-average 2018 Deyr rainfall season, many people living in the northern and central agropastoral and pastoral livelihoods zones faced deteriorating drought conditions characterized by an increased water scarcity and high levels of food insecurity. Accordingly, a post-Deyr seasonal Food Security and Nutrition Assessment indicated that 4.9 million Somalis faced acute food insecurity, an increase from 4.6 million half a year earlier. The assessment further emphasized a heightened risk of a potentially drastic increase in the number of people requiring life-saving assistance. Among these were 1.5 million people whose conditions were expected to deteriorate from 'stressed (IPC 2) to 'crisis' (IPC 3) or worse between February and June 2019, due to the impact of the current humanitarian situation compounded by the lingering effects of destitution and displacement from the 2016-2017 drought.

"In Somalia, the humanitarian situation deteriorated due to the worsening of drought conditions in the first half of 2019. The 2019 Gu rains (April to June) started late and performed poorly and were likely to further aggravate the vulnerability of those who had not recovered from both the drought of 2016 and 2017 and the flooding in 2018.

"In 2018, Madagascar faced a significant humanitarian situation in the extreme south of the country, commonly known as the Great South. The area is the poorest and most arid part of the country, receiving only 500 millimetres of average annual precipitation, making it highly vulnerable to extreme weather events and phenomena such as El Nino. In this context, drought during the October 2017 to March 2018 agricultural season, led to major losses in agricultural production in June 2018, with 50 to 85 per cent decreases in average yields reported compared previous five years. This had a significantly impact on the lives, livelihoods, food security and nutritional well-being of the already vulnerable population. According to the November 2018 projection of the Integrated Food Insecurity Classification Framework (IPC), two districts of the Great South (Beloha and Ampanihy), were classified in the “Emergency” phase for the period from November 2018 to March 2019 several pockets of emergency in the other districts. Around 890,000 people were in the “Emergency” and “Crisis” phase, of whom 460,000 required an immediate intervention. In addition, assessments indicated that as of the last quarter of 2018, 22 of 146 municipalities were in a nutritional emergency (with the majority concentrated in the district of Ampanihy), with an additional 18 others in nutritional alert.

Given the concerning sanitation situation, coupled with limited access to safe water, and with forecast more rains, the risk of potential outbreak is rising. Flooding also increased protection concerns, especially among the most vulnerable, including women and children.

"Eritrea experiences recurrent drought and variable weather conditions, which are some of the major underlying causes of vulnerability for 70 to 80 per cent of the population. Recurrent droughts contribute to food and nutrition insecurity for women, children, the elderly and for poor rural farming communities. While agricultural production in 2018 was above average due to good rainfall in some locations, pastoral and coastal areas received poor rainfall, causing concern for the food security and livelihoods of vulnerable drought-affected groups in these areas. In addition, malnutrition remains a key concern in Eritrea, with four of the six zobaszobas reporting Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rates well above WHO emergency thresholds (2016/17). While there is no Humanitarian Response Plan in Eritrea, the UNCT has an internal Basic Services Response Priorities (BSRP) document for 2019. The plan focuses on the most urgent humanitarian activities of UN agencies from within the overall agreed Strategic Partnership Cooperation Framework 2017-2021 document. The BSRP 2019 consolidates the most urgent projects from within the Food Security and Livelihoods (FSL), Nutrition; Health; Water; Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH); Education; Multi-sector Refugee Assistance as well as Child Protection sectors.

"On 24 April 2019, Tropical Cyclone Kenneth hit the Comoros archipelagos, especially the main island of Grande-Comore. At least 7 people died, 182 were injured and 19,372 displaced. More than 4,400 houses were totally destroyed and 14,970 partially destroyed. Education facilities suffered significant damages, with more than 465 classrooms destroyed including 213 totally destroyed classrooms, leaving 44,800 students without school access. At least 6 health structures covering 54,820 persons were damaged and 96 water tanks destroyed. In Moroni, the capital city, two out of three water plants were damaged which prevents a majority of the population from accessing drinking water. Around 100,000 people are estimated to face water access issues in Grande-Comore island. This increases the risk of water borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, measles and malaria. In addition, in some areas, up to 60 per cent of the food and cash crops are damaged, which critically erodes the livelihoods of the affected farmers and is expected to affect their food and nutrition security.

"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) declared an outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in August 2018, with the epicentre in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. The UN's World Health Organization assessed four priority countries at major risk of being affected by the spread of the disease beyond the national borders of the DRC. Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda are at high risk because of their proximity to the outbreak affected areas and the large-scale movement of goods and people across their border with DRC. The Government of Burundi, with its technical and financial partners, has put in place an Ebola Contingency Plan (ECP) to be prepared for the eventual spread of the disease from DRC.

"After an improvement in the humanitarian situation in Burundi between 2018 and 2019, needs have increased over the past year as a result of heavy floods, COVID-19 and an influx of returning Burundians from neighbouring countries following a renewed commitment to the repatriation of Burundian refugees. Consequently, the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan had to be revised to account for an increase of people targeted from 633,000 to 887,000 (a 40 per cent increase).  

Following the floods, more than 30,000 people currently live in IDP sites lacking most basic provisions and amenities. Food, acess to water and sanitation, shelter and protection are priorities for those who will stay in the sites and those who will return to their villages and neighbourhoods. 

The repatriation commitments between Tanzania, Burundi and UNHCR foresee 2,000 persons returning per week, made all the more difficult under COVID conditions. The primary need is to strengthen the reception framework for such a large number of people by redeveloping transit sites, making a minimum three-month assistance package available and putting in place preventive barrier measures against COVID-19.

Finally, Burundi, like many countries of the region, has a high prevalence of GBV; in the Gatumba area alone (where severe flooding took place) 475 GBV survivors were registered in June and July 2020. In most returnee areas, medical case management services are non-existent because of the lack of trained staff and equipment.",Under Implementation,770,2020,20-UF-BDI-44781,17,Burundi,BDI,2,Underfunded Emergencies,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,Burundi UF Application Oct 2020 (Displacement),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,267000,IOM;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP,5000231,2020-11-12,2020-11-17,"This allocation comes as at a pivotal moment for Burundi, just after the revision of the Humanitarian Response Plan and after the organization of general elections. The new authorities opened the doors for a revitalization of the partnership by indicating priorities confirmed by evaluations conducted jointly by humanitarian actors and their government partners. Assistance to disaster victims in Gatumba and elsewhere in the country, support for the repatriation of Burundian refugees, the activation of national solidarity to fight COVID-19 are among others the priorities of the new Government.

At this key moment, the CERF allocation will be used to strengthen and energize the partnership between the humanitarian community and the government around jointly recognized emergencies. Activities will be aligned with those prioritized by the government, focusing on people affected by natural disasters, returnees from countries neighboring Burundi and the protection of women and girls against acts of gender-based violence.

The priority identified by the United Nations team in the country is to concentrate assistance in favor of the displaced persons who are in the IDP sites, both in the Gatumba area and in makeshift sites in the city and in the provinces, making basic social services accessible: emergency food aid, shelter, water, healthcare and protection services. The changes in the context that encourage refugees to return to their country in the context of COVID-19 constitutes the second priority area. The issue of preventing and combating gender-based violence was considered cross-cutting.

The strategic use of this allocation will find support from government actors who share the choice of areas of concern. In addition, other donors will increase contributions, albeit still minimal, in the same areas and geographic areas. This allocation will further prove the relevance of investing in these areas. Finally, the activities offered under this allowance integrate and strengthen the assistance package that was offered to disaster victims and vulnerable people."
"In August 2020, vulnerable Ethiopians were facing multiple threats at once: a desert locust invasion, food insecurity, conflict, and displacement and the mounting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. On top of these crises, heavy floods and widespread cholera outbreaks were exacerbating vulnerabilities. More than 10,000 cholera cases had been reported, representing twice the total number of all of 2019. The most recent cholera outbreaks were spreading in West Omo zone in the region of Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples (SNNP) and West Guji zone of Oromia region, where only 39 per cent of the population have access to safe water and 15 per cent to sanitation. This left people to resort to unprotected water sources such as rivers, ponds and streams. Reports indicated that the excessive rainfall would peak at the end of August and continue until or beyond November. 470,000 people had been affected already by the floods including 300,000 who have been displaced, with forecasts that up to 2 million could become affected and another 400,000 could become displaced should heavy rainfall continue.

"Since end of March 2020, heavy rains had been reported in Kenya with subsequent flooding especially in West Kenya, parts of Coast, and North Eastern. Landslides were also reported in Rift, Central and Coast areas. As of 15 May 2020, more than 69,000 households (351,000 individuals) had been affected including 33,576 households, (166,000 people) who were displaced by floods in 20 out of the 23 most affected counties. In addition, as a result of the heavy rains 230 fatalities and 34 injuries were reported. In the flooded areas, almost 75% of the households reported their houses damaged or destroyed by the floods while many communities were forced to leave their homestead. There were several reports of key infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools and health facilities destroyed in multiple locations. Roads were cut off hampering humanitarian assistance in Turkana, West Pokot, Kisumu and several other counties in the Western region.

"During the 2019–2020 rainy season, southern Madagascar faced a rainfall deficit which entailed the failure of the crop and livestock production. Food security and malnutrition deteriorated and 554,000 people (24% of the population in the region) are in crisis situation (IPC3 and above). With the additional impact of COVID-19 restrictions, this situation may deteriorate as the lean season is approaching (January-March 2021).

According to the latest FEWSNET analysis from June 2020, the number of people in food insecurity will further increase between October and January, with part of the population at risk of emergency levels of food insecurity (IPC4). Water scarcity entailed an increase of the water prices along with an increase of diarrhea cases (+24% between 2018 and 2020) while the health system remains weak in the region. The disruption of the market due to the COVID-19 control measure also led to price increases for staple foods which affects the purchasing power of the most vulnerable people.

"Somalia expects to see its severely food insecure population triple to 3.5 million between July and September, up from 1.15 million at the start of 2020, due to the cumulative impacts of desert locust infestations, flooding, and COVID-19. This represents 22 per cent of the total Somali population, thereby exceeding the threshold established for the activation of the Anticipatory Action Framework that was designed in 2019. Intensified rainfall during the current Gu season caused severe riverine and flash flooding in April and May across many parts of Somalia and affected an estimated 1 million people, including 412,000 displaced people. The floods inundated and affected crops on close to 50,000 hectares of farmland in southern-central Somalia, which represents one sixth of the total land cultivated across Somalia each season. Gu rains also produced conducive conditions for additional desert locust reproduction, with the ongoing upsurge in Somalia estimated to be the worst in at least 25 years. The flooding has also led to contamination of water sources in 23 districts in the country. According to WHO’s epidemiological data for 2020, there have been 4,834 acute watery diarrhea cases, the majority in Banadir region but also in Hiran, Middle and Lower Shabelle and Bay regions. The situation can quickly escalate due to movement restrictions and a lack of basic goods and services. COVID-19 is further disrupting many aspects of life and trade that underpin food security in Somalia, including food prices, remittances and livestock trade. In line with global trends, the price of imported foods is likely to increase by 20 to 30 per cent, while local food prices have already risen. Purchasing power will decline as COVID-19 causes a reduction in incomes, which is in addition to income and production losses during the Gu season. Remittance flows are expected to fall 30 to 50 per cent through September and a similar decline is expected for livestock exports between June and August due to the cancellation of Hajj activities in Saudi Arabia.

 The Anticipatory Action Framework in Somalia was designed for severe drought shocks. While the current needs are a result of the compounding impact of the locust infestation, flooding, and the COVID-19 pandemic, food insecurity projections still show a significant deterioration, warranting the activation of the anticipatory mechanism and the mitigating actions it foresees. Some of the planned actions will require small adjustments but will remain focused on pre-agreed activities that save lives and contribute to mitigating increasing humanitarian needs.

"Uganda faces significant humanitarian needs as a result of the Covid-19 crisis as well as ongoing displacement. It registered its first case on 21 March 2020. As of August 2020, Uganda has registered 1,313 cases, including 58 refugees and 55 children, and nine deaths (as of 12 August). Hotspots include border communities and Kampala. The pandemic has had far-reaching socioeconomic impacts, disproportionally impacting vulnerable groups, exacerbating already high levels of gender-based violence (GBV).  GBV cases have increased significantly during the lockdown period: GBV Shelters have seen a 60.5 per cent increase (March to June). In refugee communities the reported cases of GBV have increased by 55 per cent.

The pandemic is set against the backdrop of one of the world’s largest refugee responses – Uganda hosts 1.4 million refugees the largest in Africa (82 per cent women and children) – and emerging humanitarian emergencies, including devastating floods and landslides (affecting 55 districts, 470,825 people, displacing 66,860 ) as well as new swarms of Desert Locusts (threatening the food security of 1.32 million people). The delivery of essential and lifesaving services, including essential GBV and SRMH services, and social protection have been disrupted, resulting in long-term impacts and loss of life for affected communities.  Many protection, legal aid and psychosocial support service providers have been restricted to remote services, limiting access by the most vulnerable and worsening already low levels of reporting and help-seeking behavior. There is a decline in utilization of antenatal care and facility deliveries in refugee hosting districts since onset of COVID-19, as well as among adolescents nationally. and the number of reported maternal deaths have since the COVID-19 lockdown have increased by 7 per cent.  
As of June 2020, 54 per cent of refugees in settlements and 26 per cent of host communities had inadequate food consumption, with relatively worse consumption in female-headed households.  Stunting has also been reported (up to 32.6 percent) in six refugee settlements. Economic loss and hunger exacerbate existing protection risks, leading to child labor, GBV, transactional sex and trafficking, SEA and child marriage. COVID-19 is also negatively impacting food security and livelihoods – especially for women and youth, who make up 86 per cent of the informal sector, urban slum residents, and refugees.

The UFE submission will focus on a multi-sectoral response to the rise in GBV, historically triggered by displacement, and exacerbated this year by COVID-19, both in refugee settlements and in urban “hot spot” areas. 
People with Disabilities. CERF interventions will also directly benefit an estimated 36,000 persons living with disabilities in eight districts. 
Protection. Uganda hosts 1.4 million refugees (82% are women and children), the largest caseload in Africa, and CERF funds will support protection interventions in these underfunded refugee settings. 
Education. Education is not addressed through this allocation. 
Projects prioritized for the CERF submission will be discussed and reviewed by the UNCT before submission to the CERF Secretariat to ensure they adequately mainstream the ERC’s priority areas.

3)	Funding envelope for GBV
Whilst $500,000 was earmarked for GBV response, the UNCT has made GBV the cornerstone of this entire allocation. CERF funds will be used to scale up GBV interventions in hotspot districts and addressing existing gaps. GBV-focused activities include specific protection interventions including legal aid, with special emphasis on working with women and youth-led organizations, and cultural and religious leaders. CERF funding will also enable agencies to scale-up GBV prevention and response to refugees – including time-critical individual case management and child protection case management for children at risk. UNHCR will catalyze a stronger legal assistance approach, offering legal aid clinics and Mobile Courts in refugee settlements to bring services closer to communities and improve access to justice; and will strengthen referral systems to ensure women and girls who experience physical and sexual violence gain access to quality multi-sectoral life-saving services. WHO will support surveillance and COVID testing for better management of GBV; and UNICEF will provide life-saving nutrition services to the most vulnerable families in refugee hosting districts and in Kampala. Local organizations working on GBV have been prioritized through partnerships with UNWOMEN and UNICEF, who have strong historical networks in these areas.

4)	Funding Requirements and Complementarity
The responses to the refugee crisis and to COVID-19 in Uganda are both critically under-funded. UNHCR estimates that it has received around 22% of its requirements for the refugee response, while FTS reports that the COVID-19 Emergency Appeal (which includes GBV) has received just 3% of the funding required. The UN Country Team launched an Emergency Appeal on COVID-19, with the aim of mobilizing US$316m to support 12.8 million people (approx. 52% women and girls). Uganda has obtained a commitment of US$2 million from the Norwegian Royal Embassy for the Multi-Partner Trust Fund, while $30 million has been mobilized outside the MPTF, leaving a considerable funding gap. The UN Uganda Multi-Partner Trust Fund/Emergency Window has been established, with an initial pledge of US US$2 million from Norway. In July 2020, Uganda was included in the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and a portfolio of interventions addressing most urgent needs was developed. CERF UFE funding will enable the UNCT to enhance coherence and leverage partnerships, and the strategy addresses humanitarian needs in a development context, closely coordinated and in coherence with government, who are proponent of ‘delivering as one’ and a champion of both the nexus and the SDGs, and with civil society. There is strong funding complementarity with other donors such as Japan who will fund WFP (not included in the CERF allocation). The strategy is aligned with the UNDP CCA, the COVID Appeal and its related socio-economic impacts, and the Cooperation Agreement with the Government.

5)	Operational Prioritization of CERF Funds
The allocation focuses on providing women and girls with access to GBV prevention and response mechanisms through integrated and survivor-centred life-saving service delivery, reducing GBV risks by supporting access to protection, time-critical life-saving and multi-purpose cash transfers for access to basic needs, and livelihoods for survivors of GBV. The allocation is targeted at preventing maternal and child mortality through the provision of timely and quality sexual, reproductive, maternal, new-born, health services within selected districts, and addressing the nutritional needs for vulnerable groups. These groups include GBV survivors and women at risk, urban communities, households with high rates of malnutrition, and people living with disabilities, including in refugee settlements. The CERF allocation will be implemented in eight districts of Uganda: Kampala and surrounding urban areas as well as in seven refugee settlements in Bidibidi, Adjumani, Palorinya, Palabek; Kyangwali, Rwamwanja and Kyaka II, targeting 400,000 people. The target population will include the elderly, people living with disabilities, women and girls, refugees, widows, female-headed households, market women, street vendors, people living with HIV and TB, and migrants."
"Since September 2019, Rwanda has experienced heavy rains that culminated in April-May 2020, causing floods and landslides in several districts across the country. Rainfall estimates show that the rains in March – April were approximately 80 per cent higher than normal, resulting in landslides and floods in scattered areas causing heightened damages including loss of life. This affected the livelihoods, agriculture, housing, infrastructure and environment sectors. Until 2 June 2020, COVID-19 movement restriction limited access for humanitarian actors which delayed the assessments and response. This has led to the Government requesting for support to respond to urgent humanitarian needs. Several assessments describe the humanitarian needs: A report issued by MINEMA in May 2020 found that all 30 districts in Rwanda were affected by the heavy rains resulting in 317 deaths. Shelter and agriculture were reported as particularly impacted; more than 8,143 houses have been partially damaged and destroyed, and 9,383 hectares of crops have been lost. A significant number of houses are still reported to be at risk of damage, owing to structural damages. The data also highlighted that owing to the current situation many households are coping by reducing the number of meals per day or reduce the quantity of food. A rapid assessment conducted in early June 2020 by the One UN in coordination with MINEMA, identified the three hardest hit districts to be Nyabihu, Ngororero and Gakenke. The report showed that 4,716 of the houses damaged were from these Districts and over 20,750 people, including children have been left homeless and approximately 2,602 hectares of agricultural land planted with various crops destroyed. Based on the existing food insecurity and poverty rates and added losses in the form of shelter and loss of livelihoods the number of food insecure people in the three districts is estimated to be 121,495 people. Living conditions for both displaced families and host families have aggravated, as well as the risk of malnutrition and increased negative coping mechanisms for families to meet basic food requirements. Women and girls’ health and their dignity have been most affected during the disaster. The increase of infectious diseases such as malaria, influenza and diarrheal diseases has been observed in the displaced population, exacerbated by overcrowded and poor hygiene living conditions. This also puts the affected population at risk of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic. In addition, Rwanda is expecting another rainy season in mid-September 2020. Addressing the humanitarian needs and return of the displaced populations and support recovery of crops before this period will be critical to ensure the situation for those most impacted is not further aggravated.",Completed,759,2020,20-RR-RWA-43884,72,Rwanda,RWA,3,Rapid Response,6,Flood,Natural Disaster,Rwanda RR Application Jun 2020 (Floods),3,Biological (human disease outbreak and other health emergency),1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,121495,FAO;IOM,1000000,2020-07-20,2020-07-22,"Since September 2019, Rwanda has experienced heavy rains that intensified in April-May 2020, causing floods and landslides in several districts across Rwanda, which in turned caused loss of lives and damages.

"Since October 2019, humanitarian conditions significantly deteriorated in Cabo Delgado province due to insecurity and floods. These events progressively led to displacements of people, the disruption of livelihoods and restricted access to basic services. Over 260 attacks by armed groups involving killings, abductions and kidnappings of civilians including girls and women, forced recruitment of children into armed groups as well as burning and looting of public and private properties and infrastructures, rapidly compounded the overall humanitarian situation.

With this funding, UN agencies and partners will provide life-saving assistance to 60,000 people, including: food assistance in-kind and in cash to 38,055 conflict-affected displaced people; agriculture assistance (vegetable seeds and tools) to 25,000 people; emergency shelter items (including sticks and bamboo) to 30,000 people; protection and psychosocial services to more than 30,000 beneficiaries including survivors of gender-based violence and children; access to safe drinking water and essential sanitation and hygiene services to about 20,000 people; camp management for 20,000 displaced people in settlements; malnutrition treatment to 220 severely and 661 moderately acutely malnourished children and 693 pregnant and lactating women, including those living with HIV; rehabilitation of schools; and provision of health services."
"The violences in Cabo Delgado have escalated significantly since January 2020, including reports of killings, beheadings, abductions and kidnappings of civilians (including girls and women), forced recruitment of children, and burning and looting of public and private properties and infrastructure. Over the first six months of 2020, attacks increased in scale and scope, with Palma, Mocimboa da Praia, Nangade, Muidumbe, Macomia and Quissanga districts hardest-hit.

"The devastating floods that affected South Sudan from June to November 2019 had a serious impact on the food security situation in the country. The heavier-than-normal floods affected the community’s productive capacity with losses of about 72,000 metric tons (MT) in cereal production and as yet unquantified livestock losses. The floods have caused extensive damage in the affected counties further compounding their vulnerability levels as 90 per cent of people affected live in counties in IPC phase 3 (crisis), and 8 per cent in IPC phase 4 (emergency). Due to the reduced household productive capacity, communities are likely to face an earlier than normal lean season as people have far less stocks to rely upon. Additionally, the prolonged floods have shortened the dry season, which is the main period for delivering supplies by road in South Sudan. The situation is expected to worsen between May to July, at the height of the lean season, more than half of the population, or 6.5 million people out of 12 million, are projected to be in IPC phase 3 or worse. Ayod and Duk are two of the counties with pockets of people in IPC phase 5 (catastrophe), while Ulang, Pibor and Maban all face IPC phase 4 throughout.

Nine districts are classified in IPC4 (one million people in food emergency) with the rest of the country classified in IPC3 (5 million people in food crisis situation). Moreover, the rampant inflation (+540.16% year on year recorded in February 2020) continues to erode purchasing power, especially the most vulnerable urban populations who rely on markets to access to food. On 2 April 2020, the HCT launched the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), which indicates that 7.7 million people need humanitarian food assistance in rural and urban areas of Zimbabwe, and 2.2 million people in urban areas have no secure access to cereal, the main staple food in Zimbabwe.",Under Implementation,748,2020,20-RR-ZWE-42705,87,Zimbabwe,ZWE,3,Rapid Response,19,Post-conflict Needs,Conflict-related,Zimbabwe RR Application Apr 2020 (Social Protection),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,5600000,WFP,19999113,2020-04-28,2020-04-28,"ince 2019, Zimbabwe has been affected by the impact of multiple hazards such as droughts, floods, cyclones, epidemics and social unrest precipitated by a protracted political and economic crisis.

Development agencies and the Government have scaled up assistance programmes across the country, with an estimated 3.9 million being assisted in rural areas. In urban areas, 2.2 million people are food insecure. At present, WFP is providing one of the main large-scale cash-based programmes in response to the urban crisis, reaching over 100,000 people, and focusing on food security and resilience-building. However, given the scale of need, much further support is required. In addition, the threat of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Zimbabwe exacerbates the vulnerability of urban households (e.g., overcrowding, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, etc.). On 2 April 2020, the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan for Zimbabwe was launched, targeting 5.6 million people with food assistance and support in the areas of health, water, sanitation and hygiene, education, protection, nutrition, shelter, and camp coordination and management.

From early 2019, the UN and humanitarian partners have been supporting the Government to respond to a complex set of humanitarian challenges in Zimbabwe. However, by August 2019 the situation had deteriorated significantly as the impact of drought and crop failure compounded by macro-economic challenges, including extraordinary inflation rate, and austerity measures mean that 6.7 million Zimbabweans are in need of humanitarian assistance both in rural districts and urban centres.

"In December 2019 a spike in military operations led to large-scale displacement, primarily in the North-West (NW) but also in the South-West (SW) regions - regions which were already host to some 450,000 IDPs. Between 15 October 2019 and 9 January 2020 IOM’s Emergency Tracking Tool documented the displacement of 19,500 people due to hostilities, though given that IOM's tool was unable to cover all affected locations, the total number of displaced was likely much higher. Continuous displacement, even if temporary, was forcing the chronically displaced to sell their assets to survive, further increasing their vulnerability. Meanwhile, humanitarian partners were already struggling to respond to the existing needs of those already displaced, mostly due to a lack of financial and adequate human resources. In parallel, cases of cholera were reported in the Bakassi and Ekondo Titi health districts of the SW region. Some 380 cases were recorded as of 9 January 2020, with a case fatality rate of 4.2 per cent.

"Since 2018 southern Angola has been experiencing severe drought, which has led to rising hunger and acute malnutrition, and left at least 1.5 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. The most affected provinces are Cuando Cubango, Cunene, Huila, Namibe, Bie, Cuanza Sul and Banguela. Some 562,000 people out of 904,000 people in the 23 locations assessed are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. They will face difficulties in accessing food or will be able to meet only minimum food needs through emergency lifesaving interventions in the coming months. Food security in 14 out of 23 areas was projected to be in Emergency (IPC phase 4) in the period October 2019 to February 2020. The increased impacts of the drought from October 2019 to February 2020 has led to a new nutrition emergency in southern Angola, with increasing numbers of children presenting symptoms of severe acute malnutrition (SAM). A nutrition (SMART) survey conducted in early December 2019 in the ten most affected municipalities of Huila and Cunene suggested a serious nutrition situation. The prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) in Huila was 10.8 per cent and the SAM rate was 2.1 per cent. In Cunene GAM was 10.6 per cent and SAM 1.1 per cent. Access to safe drinking water and sanitation services was already low prior to the drought and has decreased further, heightening the risk of communicable diseases. In Huila, 35.5 per cent of the population has access to safe drinking water, while in Cunene only 23 per cent of the population has access to safe water and only 12 per cent of households use toilets. Access to education has also been affected, as the mostly pastoralist families take their sons out of school to travel longer distances in search for pasture and water.

Swarms also appeared in Angola. Despite sustained control campaigns by the five concerned countries, the AML outbreak continues to spread from initial areas, representing now a critical threat to the food and nutrition security and livelihoods of vulnerable communities and households. For the four last months, Red Locust infestations have also appeared putting an additional risk of crop and grazing failure in the region. Irrigated crops and grazing have been devastated in some areas and locusts are posing a grave threat to the main planting season that will commence in November 2020.

In September 2020, a $18.9 million Regional Locust Response Plan (RLRP) was developed by FAO, SADC, IRLSCOCSA and other key stakeholders, and launched by SADC. It includes a $3.9 million emergency locust control component and a $15 million component for food security and the restoration of livelihoods. This Regional Response Plan is in turn anchored into respective National Locust Response Plans (NLRPs) that have been developed by the respective humanitarian community (UNCT/RCO, NGOs and the government response team).

"The humanitarian situation in Niger greatly in 2020 deteriorated due to the worsening security situation along the borders with Nigeria, Mali and Burkina Faso. According to 2020 HNO, 2.9 million people were in need of humanitarian assistance. Also, around 400,000 people had been forced to flee their homes due to insecurity and were living in very precarious conditions. In addition, Niger was facing food and nutrition crises, epidemics and recurrent floods. According to the “Cadre Harmonisé” of November 2019, nearly 1.4 million people were estimated to be food insecure – a figure that was predicted to rise to 1.9 million by mid-2020.",Report Available,739,2020,20-UF-NER-40771,66,Niger,NER,2,Underfunded Emergencies,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,Niger UF Application Mar 2020 (Displacement),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,5,Western Africa,6,Western Africa,1,Africa,400000,FAO;IOM;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,10951371,2020-03-20,2020-03-30,Summary will be available soon.
"From mid-January to April 2020, large numbers of people were forced to flee their homes due to armed conflict in the Tillabéri region, as well as in the regions of Tahoua and Diffa. These newly displaced people are not included in the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan for Niger. UNHCR and the National Eligibility Committee estimate as of 4 March 2020 that some 17,031 people have fled their homes in Tillabéri region, of which some are in secondary displacement. In addition to this internal displacement, some 3,000 Malian refugees have settled in Niger and Nigeriens have crossed the border into Mali.

In the Tahoua region, some 23,102 people currently displaced in Tilia and Agando are moving to more secure areas due to armed conflict in December 2019. As of 21 February 2020, the Protection Cluster and humanitarian actors have identified 1,506 people displaced from Agando. These people are also displaced for the second time. In addition, 5,000 refugees in the Intikane Refugee Reception Area in Tahoua region need to be relocated for security reasons. As of 31 December 2019, Tillaberi region hosted 57,742 displaced people and Tahoua 23,102. Humanitarian actors estimate that all internally displaced people in Tillabéri and Tahoua are at risk of second displacement due to armed conflict.

In addition to the humanitarian consequences linked to these displacements, affected people are also facing food insecurity. Analysis indicates that four out of 13 departments in the Tillabéri region have a high concentration of people suffering from food insecurity. The prevalence of food insecurity could persist at crisis level or turn into an emergency, with an increase in the proportion of people affected in six departments of the Tillabéri region. This precarious food situation also impacts the nutritional situation in this region. The results of the 2019 SMART survey show a worsening of the situation with a prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) of 10.7% above the alert threshold of 10%. As in Tillaberi and Tahoua, kidnappings, robberies and deadly attacks by non-state armed groups are reported almost daily in the Diffa region. As of 21 February, 11,500 people have been displaced by growing insecurity, including 10,228 internally displaced people and 1,272 refugees and returnees.",Completed,749,2020,20-RR-NER-42550,66,Niger,NER,3,Rapid Response,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,Niger RR Application Apr 2020 (Displacement),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,5,Western Africa,6,Western Africa,1,Africa,190412,UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP,6001054,2020-05-01,2020-05-14,"The ERC has endorsed a CERF rapid response request of up to $6 million for humanitarian partners in Niger.

"In 2020, 4.6 million people will need humanitarian assistance, corresponding to one in three Haitians. The latest IPC analysis indicates that as many as 4.1 million people (40% of the population) are at risk of food insecurity as of March 2020, including 1.2 million (12% of the population) in emergency phase and 2.8 million people (28% of the population in crisis phase). Increasing prices for basic foods, the depreciation of the Gourde (Haitian currency), socio-political unrest and deteriorating security conditions have greatly reduced access to food for the poorest households. In rural areas, the 2018 drought, which extended into the first half of 2019, caused agricultural production in some parts of the country to drop by about 12% compared to the year prior. Malnutrition also increased in 2019. Between January and August, nutritional screening data indicated global acute malnutrition rates of up to 10% in some regions. 

The unrest that hit Haiti in 2019 severely affected the capacity of already very fragile health facilities and provision of services. Latest estimates from the Ministry of Education indicated that at least 3 million children across the country did not have access to school in the first quarter of the current school year. In addition, more than 60% of schools were closed, 57% of schools do not have access to any drinking water, and 45% do not have toilets. The combination of food insecurity, reduced livelihoods, lack of access to school and the general increase in the vulnerability of families, generate high risks, including physical violence, trafficking and/or sexual exploitation for children and young people.

According to a survey conducted in December 2019, 45% of respondents considered the highest risk for children and adolescents outside of school was gang recruitment. The almost permanent insecurity creates an environment conducive to an increase in protection incidents. The main concern remains poor access to basic services for survivors of abuse, and a weak capacity for effective response by service providers. In addition, almost a third (29%) of women have experienced physical or sexual violence. Responses to medical and psychological needs as well as legal support and social protection are insufficient and become almost non-existent in the event of a crisis. In 2019, gender-based violence prevention and response systems and services were repeatedly interrupted, particularly putting women and girls at risk of human rights violations, physical and sexual violence and abuse.

This very concerning situation is coupled to an increasing acute malnutrition with a peak of 2.5% of severe acute malnutrition rate in December 2019. In addition, with the increasing insecurity in urban areas, the sociopolitical crisis has limited the access to vulnerable people including the persons living with disabilities to social services.

"The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the most vulnerable populations in Colombia, aggravating pre-existing conditions including the impact of internal conflict dynamics, natural disasters and large migration movements. With the expansion of the pandemic in the country, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance has doubled, from five million at the end of 2019 to 10 million today. The rural departments of Chocó and Nariño are among the most affected by the armed conflict in the country, leading to mass displacements and forced confinement with a severe impact on rural, mostly indigenous population and in particular on women and children. Both departments are heavily impacted by the pandemic with 620 confirmed cases per 100,000 habitants and one out of five processed tests being positive (as of August 2020), indicating a high infection rate. The poverty rate in Chocó (61.1%) is among the highest in Colombia, as is the level of food insecurity at household level (76.8%).

"The humanitarian situation in DPRK is characterized by chronic food insecurity, undernutrition, and lack of access to life-saving quality services. 10.1 million people are in urgent need of food assistance; 10.4 million need nutrition support as well as improved access to basic services such as health, clean water, sanitation and hygiene. Insufficient agricultural production drives high levels of Food insecurity, and poor food consumption and inadequate dietary diversity has a direct impact on the chronic malnutrition situation, especially on children, women of reproductive age and the elderly.  Undernutrition remains a protracted and chronic issue. Health facilities lack sufficient medicines, equipment and expertise to provide quality services. The consequences are particularly acute for women and children, with a lack of reproductive health services a key driver of the high maternal mortality rate (65.9 per 100,000 live births). Diarrhea and pneumonia remain the two main causes of death among children under age 5. The spread of diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB) (including multidrug-resistant tuberculosis) and malaria, remain a major public health concern.

"Over the last 25 years, storms and floods have resulted in around 15,000 deaths and affected 150 million people in Bangladesh. Approximately 80% of Bangladesh’s yearly rainfall occurs during the main monsoon season between June and October. The 2019 floods affected over 7.6 million people, and damaged nearly 550,000 homes. Floods usually occur March to September with peaks between June and September, although research shows that the monsoon season is moving earlier due to climate change. In some years monsoon flooding in Bangladesh is intense and surpasses the ability of communities to cope, leading to deaths and the destruction of key infrastructure, livelihoods and homes. This creates widespread humanitarian needs with longer term development consequences. It is often possible to predict severe monsoon flooding events and a targeted anticipatory approach can lead to a more timely, effective, efficient and dignified solution to respond to and ultimately reduce humanitarian needs.",Completed,757,2020,20-RR-BGD-44022,12,Bangladesh,BGD,3,Rapid Response,6,Flood,Natural Disaster,Bangladesh RR Application Jun 2020 (Anticipatory Action - Floods),3,Biological (human disease outbreak and other health emergency),1,Natural Disaster,10,Southern Asia,13,Southern Asia,3,Asia,0,FAO;UNFPA;WFP,5189062,2020-07-06,2020-07-06,Summary will be available soon.

The extreme weather conditions have especially affected nine provinces in central Viet Nam, flooding at least 380.000 houses and compromising people’s access to key infrastructure such as water supplies, sanitation facilities, health centers and schools. The additional scarcity of food supplies and other basic household items has further compounded the humanitarian situation. On 13 October 2020, the Government of Viet Nam, which has been leading search, rescue and relief operations, initially called for international support and later reiterated this request at a meeting with the Disaster Management Group (DMG) on 27 October.

"Now in its ninth year, Lebanon remains at the forefront of one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time and continues to host the highest number of displaced persons per capita in the world. As of November 2019, the Government of Lebanon (GoL) estimates that the country hosts 1.5 million Syrians who have fled the conflict in Syria (including 918,874 registered as refugees with UNHCR), along with 27,700 Palestine refugees from Syria (PRS) and a pre-existing population of an estimated 180,000 Palestine refugees from Lebanon (PRL). Displaced Syrians are scattered over 1,500 municipalities across the country; 20 per cent of these are in informal settlements and the rest reside in urban areas, gatherings and residential areas. As for Palestine refugees, most live in the 12 organized camps, while the remaining reside in 156 gatherings. Although some of them are in the vicinity of camps, these are not part of the official settlements, or are dispersed throughout Lebanon. The conflict in Syria has significantly impacted Lebanon’s social development and economic growth, contributed to deepening poverty and increased humanitarian needs, and exacerbated pre-existing development constraints in the country. According to the 2019 Vulnerability Assessment for Syrian Refugees, poverty levels amongst Syrian and Palestine refugees and poor Lebanese are rising, aggravated by a series of emergencies, ranging from natural disasters and economic constraints to evictions, and this has impacted their ability to cope with the crisis. Obtaining civil documentation remains a challenge, with only 22 per cent of Syrian refugees over the age of 15 holding legal residency. Refugees are becoming more economically vulnerable with the proportion of Syrian refugees spending less than $2.90/per day increasing from 51 per cent to 55 per cent in 2019. Shelter conditions have not improved from 2018 with over half (57 per cent) of Syrian refugee families living in overcrowded shelters, shelters below humanitarian standards and/or shelters in danger of collapse. The proportion of families citing cost as a barrier to accessing health care has increased substantially in 2018, suggesting that economic vulnerability is a notable common denominator for these families. More households are resorting to crisis livelihood-related coping strategies, especially through reducing expenditure on health, education and selling productive assets.

Women are underrepresented in the formal labour market in Lebanon, with 23 per cent compared to 71 per cent of men. Children constitute around 30 per cent of the total labour force in agriculture, followed by women at a rate of 43 per cent. Persons with specific needs (PSN), including female heads of households as well as older persons and youth, have been disproportionately affected 
due to restricted ability to provide for themselves, purchase essential goods and access critical services. This also includes subsidized services provided by public institutions due to an increase in transportation costs and budget cuts.  They are more likely to resort to negative coping mechanisms including child labour and child marriage or to be exposed to exploitation.  PSN have less ability to absorb additional shocks due to their intrinsic vulnerability, limited support and already strained resilience mechanisms.",Completed,729,2020,20-UF-LBN-40772,52,Lebanon,LBN,2,Underfunded Emergencies,19,Post-conflict Needs,Conflict-related,Lebanon UF Application Feb 2020 (Multiple),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,14,Western Asia,15,Western Asia,3,Asia,2700000,UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;UNRWA;WHO,12988434,2020-03-05,2020-03-05,Summary will be available soon.
"The 4 August 2020 explosion of a warehouse in Beirut Port containing 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate caused widespread damage and loss of life in the immediate vicinity of central Beirut. At least 175 people were killed while many remain missing and more than 5,000 people were injured. At total of 1,144 buildings were assessed as at risk of collapse with more than 30,600 people having to vacate. More broadly, the blast wave damaged thousands of apartments in other buildings. The length of displacement will vary depending notably on the level of damage sustained to houses and apartments. It may extend to six months to a year in the case of the most severely-destroyed buildings. A rapid shelter assessment identified Beirut’s districts of Gemmayzeh, Mar Mikhael, Ashrafiyeh and Qarantina as priority areas, but extensive shelter needs are also to be found in the impoverished areas east and south of the blast site (among others, Burj Hammoud). Six major hospitals and twenty clinics sustained partial or heavy structural damage and out of 55 medical facilities within a 15-kilometre radius of the explosions, only half are fully operational and around 40 per cent have suffered moderate to serious damage and need rehabilitation. The destruction of Beirut Port and accompanying structures, such as animal and plant quarantine facilities, has had a direct effect on the country’s food availability. Lebanon’s grain silos, holding up to 120,000 metric tonnes, were destroyed. Lebanon depends heavily on imports, including food supply. The explosion has led to mass casualties with thousands of wounded, increased shortages of medicines, disposable and dressing materials and equipment required across the healthcare system in Lebanon.

"The conflict in Syria continues to be the world’s largest displacement crisis, with Jordan highly impacted by the influx of people who have sought refuge in the country, many for up to nine years. As of 31 December 2019, UNHCR has registered 745,169 refugees in Jordan, the majority of whom (654,692) are Syrian. Most Syrian refugees live in urban communities (531,432), with the remaining 18.8 per cent in camps, principally the Azraq and Zaatari camps. 

In addition to the Syrian refugee caseload, the Kingdom is home to 56 other nationalities of refugees and asylum seekers – predominantly Iraqi (67,188), Yemeni (14,774), Sudanese (6,096) and Somali (744).  Like Syria refugees, the vast of these groups live urban areas. Jordan hosts the second largest number of refugees relative to the size of its population, with 1 in 14 people in the Kingdom a refugee. The large additional population has had a considerable impact on the country’s economy, infrastructure, health and education systems. 

Nearly 80 per cent of the refugees in host communities fall below the national poverty line of JOD 68 (US$100) per person per month. This underlines the hardships refugees face in meeting their daily needs, including access to adequate shelter, food, healthcare and education.

Amongst the most vulnerable displaced communities in southern Syria are the estimated 12,000 people living in a 55-kilometer area near Jordan’s northern border controlled by the International Coalition Forces (ICF). Originating from Homs, Aleppo and Dar’a, including areas previously controlled by ISIL, this population is exposed to the harsh desert conditions with very irregular access to humanitarian assistance, first from the Jordan side of the border and from mid-2018, Damascus.  

Over 120,000 Palestine refugees from Syria (PRS) have fled in search of safety and protection elsewhere, mainly in Lebanon and Jordan. PRS started to enter Jordan during the first year of the conflict, joining some 2.3 million Palestinian refugees already present in Jordan. Although admissions of PRS to Jordan were curtailed in 2013, following government policy changes, the inflow did not stop, in part because many PRS have some forms of Jordanian documentation.

"The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health emergency affecting all countries worldwide. While the scope of the epidemic differs between countries, the disease rapidly propagates in the vast majority of them, affecting an increasing number of people. Although to date few cases have been reported in countries with humanitarian response plans, this situation has the potential to change very quickly. In a span of just 11 weeks from January to mid-March 2020, the virus has progressed from a discrete outbreak in Wuhan, China, to clusters of cases in many countries, and then to a pandemic with most countries reporting cases, and many experiencing significant outbreaks. Thus far, overall fatality rates have been higher than 3 per cent, and considerably higher for older people and those with underlying health conditions. The virus is also affecting the health of younger adults. Without decisive action, massive outbreaks will happen around the world. In countries facing pre-COVID-19 humanitarian needs, these measures are impacting the delivery of humanitarian assistance by limiting the movement of goods, aid workers and beneficiaries, and disrupting transportation services and domestic and international trade. The number of international aid agencies’ staff is decreasing as a result of entry and exit restrictions. These effects are highly problematic as conflict and other disasters are not stopping for the disease, and humanitarian assistance remains imperative. This requires increased partnership and support to national and local staff and organizations that are equally impacted but retain a greater capacity to operate locally than international agencies, provided they receive the necessary resources and are able to act. The majority of countries with an ongoing humanitarian response have weak health systems and governance combined with poor basic service delivery. This will severely constrain their ability to prevent the spread of the epidemic and provide health care to infected people, as well as sustain health services to the general population, including sexual and reproductive health services, mental health and psychosocial support, and overall management of non-communicable diseases. The effects of the pandemic on people and institutions are compounded by pre-existing drivers of humanitarian needs such as conflict or civil unrest, disaster, poverty and inequality – including gender inequality and discrimination – environmental degradation, food insecurity, malnutrition, poor health, water and sanitation infrastructure and services, low education levels, limited social safety nets or social assistance, unequal access to information and others.",Completed,745,2020,20-RR-GLB-42285,269,Global,GLB,3,Rapid Response,31,COVID-19,Disease Outbreak,Global RR Application Apr 2020 (COVID-19),2,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",0,,23,Global,24,Global,6,Global,0,FAO;IOM;UN Habitat;UNDP;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,80000024,2020-04-02,2020-04-14,"On 25 March the Emergency Relief Coordinator launched a $2 billion global humanitarian response plan to fight COVID-19 in some of the world’s most vulnerable countries in a bid to protect millions of people and stop the virus from circling back around the globe.

It has a foothold across the globe and is now reaching countries that were already facing humanitarian crisis because of conflict, natural disasters and climate change. To kick-start the response plan, the ERC released an additional $60 million from CERF's Rapid Response Window. This brings CERF’s support to humanitarian action in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to $75 million. This new CERF allocation – one of the largest ever made – will support: WFP to ensure the continuity of supply chains and transport of aid workers and relief goods; WHO to contain the spread of the pandemic; and other agencies to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to those most affected by the pandemic, including women and girls, refugees and internally displaced people. Support will include efforts around food security, physical and mental health, water and sanitation, nutrition and protection."
"The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented public health emergency affecting all countries worldwide. While the scope of the pandemic differs between countries, the disease rapidly propagates in the vast majority of them, affecting an increasing number of people. Data and analysis conducted since the release of the Global Humanitarian Response Plan in late March 2020 confirm the anticipated humanitarian impact of the pandemic on the health and socioeconomic conditions of vulnerable groups. Concerns are growing around the disruption of essential health services as lockdown measures and fear of infection are leading to significant reductions in utilization and access. Due to disruption of air flights, vaccines shipments to countries fell by approximately 80 per cent, and an increasing number of countries are reporting depleting stock, impairing essential vaccination campaigns. Those who stand out as suffering the most are older persons, people with comorbidities, people with mental health and psychosocial needs, persons with disabilities, women, children and youth, forcibly displaced persons, refugees, asylum seekers and migrants, and people who have lost their sources of income and fall outside social protection systems.

"On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to a cluster of pneumonia patients in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. One week later Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a novel (new) coronavirus as the cause of the pneumonia: COVID-19. The following weeks saw an exponential growth in number of cases and deaths, first in China and then worldwide, with ongoing community transmission and rapid international spread. The number of cases rose from 11,953 on 1 February to 88,948 as of 2 March, with 3,043 deaths in 72 countries. Since the first cases were reported, WHO, UNICEF and partner agencies have been working with Chinese authorities and global experts to learn more about the virus, including how it is transmitted, the populations most at risk, the spectrum of clinical disease, and the most effective ways to detect, interrupt, and contain human-to-human transmission and mitigate the impact of the outbreak, including the social impacts inherent to the outbreak response.",Completed,738,2020,20-RR-GLB-41473,269,Global,GLB,3,Rapid Response,31,COVID-19,Disease Outbreak,Global RR Application Mar 2020 (COVID-19),2,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",0,,23,Global,24,Global,6,Global,0,UNICEF;WHO,15000000,2020-03-11,2020-03-12,"The Emergency Relief Coordinator released $15 million on 1 March from CERF's Rapid Response Window to help fund global efforts by WHO and UNICEF to contain the COVID-19 epidemic.

"On 8 April, Tropical Cyclone (TC) Harold passed straight over the islands of Kadavu, Vatulele and the Lau group, which are 1-3 days travel from Suva. TC Harold affected more than 186,000 Fijians according to the Minister for National Disaster Management. TC Harold caused widespread and significant destruction of structures, blocked roads due to fallen trees and caused flash flooding over low-lying areas and areas close to riverbanks, including sea flooding in low lying coastal areas. Airstrips and infrastructure were largely wiped out and access is extremely difficult. Power outages throughout the affected areas made it difficult to immediately quantify the damage, disrupting radiotelephone, landline phones and mobile phone networks on most of the affected islands. Entire villages were destroyed. Homes and crops were damaged, and power lines have been cut. The Fiji National Disaster Management Office activated their Emergency Operations Centre to streamline preparations and evacuation. Damages to homes, public infrastructure, food, water supply and health services across majority of Islands in the Lau Group, Kadavu Group and Yasawa Islands were extensive. Across Fiji, 25 evacuation centres were initially opened with 22 in the Western Division and 3 in the Central Division; at least 2,146 people sought shelter in the centres. The number of shelters and evacuees increased during and after Harold's passage; over 6,000 people sought refuge at 197 evacuation centres, with at least two in each of Fiji's four districts.

The declaration was for certain parts of the Eastern, Central and Western Divisions of the country. The Eastern Division was most affected, where the majority of the national response is concentrated. Approximately 20,000 people live in these remote islands, and logistics is both expensive and challenging (compounded by COVID-19 constraints). It is estimated that the entire population of these islands is affected, with 95 percent of agriculture, 30 percent of schools, 30 percent of shelters and 70 percent of national services significantly damaged.

The key strategic objectives of the CERF allocation are a reflection of the critical life-saving assistance urgently required, and include two objectives: (1) Support to the provision of timely live-saving assistance to people affected by the cyclone through safe drinking water, food assistance, nutrition support, health care, emergency shelter and NFIs, logistics operation and protection measures, and (2) support to national efforts to restore livelihoods and self-reliance by re-establishing food security, cash assistance, repair and reconstruction of shelters and housing, repair local infrastructure and increase access for education in emergencies."
"The trigger for this CERF rapid response allocation is the massive displacement of people in northwest Syria following an increase in military hostilities. Due to an escalation in fighting, there has been an increasing level and pace of new displacements. As of 13 February 2020, 800,000 people had moved since 1 December 2019, primarily from southern Idleb and western Aleppo governorates. A significant portion of newly displaced people in northwest Syria had previously been displaced by conflict in recent months, reflecting a trend of compounding primary, secondary, and tertiary displacements in the region. Some 80 per cent of displaced people are women and children. This massive displacement has taken place at the depths of a harsh winter, when temperatures fall as low as minus 8 degrees Celsius with lot of rain and snowfall. The humanitarian situation for people in northwest Syria has deteriorated significantly since mid-December 2019. There are an estimated 4 million people living in northwest Syria. The Whole of Syria Population & IDP Task Force estimated in the 2020 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) that the greater Idleb de-escalation zone was host to some 3.1 million people prior to this escalation in movement. Of the total population, some 2.2 million people were deemed to be in need of humanitarian support and some 1.6 million people were known to have been displaced people. The latest mass population movement follows the displacement of some 400,000 people in northwest Syria between May and August 2019, some of whom are now being displaced yet again. In total, at least 2.8 million people in northwest Syria are estimated to require humanitarian assistance, comprising host communities, newly displaced people and people displaced during previous escalations of hostilities.",Completed,726,2020,20-RR-SYR-40986,78,Syrian Arab Republic,SYR,3,Rapid Response,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,Syria RR Application Feb 2020 (Displacement),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,14,Western Asia,15,Western Asia,3,Asia,800000,IOM;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP,29995744,2020-02-14,2020-02-17,Summary will be available soon.

Nine years on from the start of the crisis, 6.1 million people remain internally displaced and 5.6 million people have fled their homes to neighbouring countries. In 2019, over 1.5 million people were displaced inside Syria. There has been, and continues to be, extensive damage to crucial civilian infrastructure, such as schools, water supply systems, health facilities, and housing. In areas where hostilities have subsided, life remains a daily struggle due to limited access to basic services, increasing financial hardship and eroding coping capacities.

"The humanitarian situation in Yemen keeps escalating as fighting continues to erupt on multiple frontlines around the country. An estimated 24.3 million people, 80 per cent of the entire population, require some form of humanitarian assistance. A decline in basic health service utilization was observed during the first quarter of 2020, which is primarily a result of defunding of the humanitarian response. The decline is also influenced by the violent conflict and the COVID-19 outbreak. The lack of funding led to the closure or reduction of many services, most notably health services supported by UNFPA, WHO and IOM as well as by the frontline NGO partners. The reports by Health Cluster partners indicated that during June – September 2020, health services will be suspended in 480 health facilities, affecting 5.6 million people. Further services will be reduced over the upcoming months if funding is not made available.



The CERF allocation will support health facilities in the areas of high severity to ensure delivery of reproductive health services, especially life-saving Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (EmONC). Priority will be given to those facilities that had to discontinue service provision due to the decreased funding. It will also prioritize providing essential lifesaving health services based on the Minimum Services Package (MSP), a core component of which is water.


In April 2020, the Nutrition cluster reported a drop of attendance to nutrition services of up to 50 per cent in some Therapeutic Feeding Centers (TFCs). The lack of funding also has impacted the ability of nutrition partners to ensure logistic support, monitoring and supervision and maintenance of nutrition sites.

"At the beginning of February 2021 intense clashes broke out in several districts of Ma’rib and Al Jawf governorates leading to a large-scale displacement and further deterioration of living conditions of already displaced populations. Initial field reports indicated massive displacement within Ma’rib Governorate, especially from Sirwah District, which had seen the heaviest fighting. Ma’rib Governorate already hosts an estimated 800,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) – the largest IDP population in Yemen according to local authorities. According to the IOM, some people have been displaced three times and most newly displaced people had been living in displacement sites, with some reportedly carrying their shelters with them to their new locations. An estimated 60 per cent of newly displaced people are residing in informal settlements or crowded sites with limited access to basic services.

"Unrest in the occupied Palestinian territory has been on the rise since mid- April, initially in East Jerusalem, spreading to other parts of the West Bank and then extending to Gaza. The period between 10 and 21 May witnessed the most serious escalation of hostilities between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in the Gaza Strip since the 2014 conflict. In parallel, there has been a significant rise in unrest in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. In Gaza, the humanitarian consequences have been devastating. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), up to 21 May, 242 Palestinians, including 66 children and 38 women were killed, of whom 129 were believed to be civilians. Almost 2,000 Palestinians were injured during the hostilities, including over 600 children and 400 women. High intensity bombing has caused widespread psycho-social impacts. In Gaza, around 2,000 housing units were totally destroyed or damaged beyond repair, and nearly 15,000 units suffered some degree of damage, resulting in over 36,000 people being currently displaced with host families. Over 70,000 were displaced in UNRWA schools at the height of hostilities. A total of 54 education facilities, six hospitals and eleven primary health care centres sustained damage across the Strip. Multiple water and sanitation facilities and infrastructure were hit and damaged in more than 100 Israeli strikes. Daily power supply has been reduced to only 5-6 hours, down from 15 hours previously. All this has severely undermined the living conditions and access to basic services by the entire population.

In Israel there were at least 12 fatalities including two children, and hundreds of injuries.

The violence displaced over 77,000 Palestinians who were seeking protection in 58 UNRWA schools, including in 23 designated emergency shelters (DES). There was concern about the transmission of COVID-19 between vulnerable people who huddled in crowded shelters and the inability of the health-care system to cope. Many people have returned home since.

The hostilities also caused serious damage to vital civilian infrastructure in Gaza affecting water, sanitation and hygiene services for hundreds of thousands of people. Hundreds of buildings and homes have been destroyed, damaged, or rendered uninhabitable.

"The COVID-19 situation exacerbated already existing gender inequalities, and brought about a marked increase in incidents of gender-based violence (GBV) affecting primarily women and girls, while putting others at risk. This is the primary trigger for this allocation. Women and girls are already experiencing enhanced vulnerabilities during humanitarian crises – which the COVID-19 situation has brought to the forefront. Increases in GBV incidents, including but not limited to domestic violence, intimate partner violence, physical abuse, forced coexistence, forced and early marriages, are aggravated symptoms of a situation made far worse by the global pandemic. 

Women and girls worldwide, and especially in the countries targeted by the present global allocation, are in acute need of protection engagements and more resilience-oriented measures, in order to save their lives, alleviate their suffering and preserve their dignity. The 11 countries included in this allocation were already experiencing longstanding humanitarian crises of their own, which the global pandemic has further aggravated.

The allocation is protection-focused (and specifically on GBV outcomes, targeting mainly women and girls). The projects target GBV survivors, at risk and vulnerable women and girls, including those with disabilities. Men and boys are engaged to be sensitized about GBV. The activities proposed are based on their unique needs that aim to achieve positive outcomes for women and girls. Agencies in the allocation put protection at the core of their activities and aim to promote women’s safety and dignity, including building their capacity to live with increased safety and dignity throughout their displacement. This allocation considers the risks of resistance and backlash from the community when trying to change gender norms and gender barriers and will therefore carefully monitor the  impact on the community and women beneficiaries to respect the Do No Harm principles and ensure the participants’ safety.",Under Implementation,783,2021,20-RR-GLB-46341,269,Global,GLB,3,Rapid Response,22,Human Rights,Unspecified Emergency,Global RR Application Dec 2020 (GBV programming),5,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,23,Global,24,Global,6,Global,20000000,UN Women;UNFPA,25004109,2021-02-09,2021-02-12,Summary will be available soon.

The HCT intends to focus on four priorities: (1) Provide shelter to 10,000 households; (2) Ensure safe access to sanitations services at new sites for displaced people and host communities; (3) Strengthen the prevention of, and response to, protection issues including child protection, gender-based violence and managing the risk of improvised explosive devices; and (4) Improve access to basic health care for displaced people and host communities, including sexual and reproductive health. This request is aimed at kick-starting a multi-sectoral response to the Spring Contingency Plan. The strategy is focused on 4 sectors: nutrition, health, WASH and agriculture. In particular agricultural and livelihoods assistance is expected to prevent some displacement due to water scarcity and drought-like conditions. CERF resources will be focused in the high and medium risk areas identified in the Spring Plan. The overall number of people to be reached is 630,000, as per the request."

"Following intercommunal conflict and violence in West Darfur which started on 15 January 2021, approximately 109,000 people had been displaced across Ag Geneina locality. This follows a trend of inter-communal clashes which took place in 2020 in the same area, which resulted in the displacement of 41,000 people. Recurring tensions and conflict between Arab tribes and other ethnic groups have taken place for more than 10 years in Ag Geneina. In 2020, half of the 40 incidents of intercommunal violence in Darfur took place in West Darfur. The severity of the incidents in West Darfur added to the cycle of other emergencies which took place across Sudan in 2020 – including COVID-19, inter-communal clashes in South Kordofan and other Darfur states, flooding, and the arrival of more than 60,000 refugees from Ethiopia's Tigray region into Sudan – has led to increased humanitarian needs.

The emergency response to intercommunal violence in West Darfur is complementary to programmes on 'durable solutions for forced displacement' of the Peacebuilding Fund (PBF) in West Darfur, led by UNHCR and implemented jointly with UNDP, UNICEF and IOM, with a value of $4.32 million (part of a wider programme of $20 million for peacebuilding in the Darfur States). An ongoing 2020 CERF allocation of $100 million, of which $40 million is for underserved emergencies, implemented in the Darfur, Kordofan and Blue Nile States, focuses on building effective approaches to resilience and solutions that assist displaced people, wider displacement-affected communities as well as the Government of Sudan to better manage and overcome the consequences and effects of displacement.",Under Implementation,807,2021,21-RR-SDN-47060,76,Republic of the Sudan,SDN,3,Rapid Response,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,Sudan RR Application Apr 2021 (Inter-communal violence in W Darfur),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,3,Northern Africa,3,Northern Africa,1,Africa,135000,FAO;IOM;UNFPA;UNICEF;WHO,4999194,2021-04-20,2021-04-21,"Following intercommunal conflict and violence in West Darfur, approximately 109,000 people have been displaced, in particular across Ag Geneina locality.

In the most affected south western provinces, rainfall was 40-60% below average. While rainfall has improved in recent months, this was too late to recover crop production. The drastically reduced harvest and its impact on livelihoods have created an alarming food insecurity and nutrition crisis. The crisis has also expanded geographically, from three to six provinces now affected by drought. Restrictions imposed due to COVID-19 have also impacted livelihoods leading to loss of family income, increased risks of violence, including gender-based violence, and heightened child protection concerns, particularly during school closures. Currently, 5.9m people, or 19% of the population of Angola, are experiencing food shortages – up from 3.8m people at the end of March and 1.6m people in 2020.

"On 22 May 2021, the Nyiragongo volcano near the city of Goma in eastern DRC erupted with lava streams pouring down towards the east and the city itself. The lava flow, ash, and gas as well as the multiple ensuing earthquakes destroyed houses, public buildings (schools and health structures), and fields. Water and electricity supply systems have also been affected and roads cut off. 

In the evening of 26 May, the government of DRC ordered the evacuation of 10 neighborhoods in the eastern part of Goma as a cautionary measure. Approximately 390,445 people (or 78,000 households) moved towards the west (Sake and surrounding villages, until reaching Bukavu along Lake Kivu) and towards the north (road to Rutshuru), while others crossed the border to Rubavu in Rwanda. Most people moved by foot, taking with them what they could. This large movement of population has placed additional stress on host communities and services in neighboring areas and increases the risk of a cholera outbreak in the area.

The humanitarian community developed a response strategy to cover the needs of the affected population by the Volcanic Eruption, aiming to:

1.	Provide immediate assistance to meet the needs of displaced and host populations in food security (food), shelter, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health (with focus on epidemics - cholera and mental health), and protection (including VBG and child protection); and

2.	Support the return movements to the most vulnerable among the displaced (transportation).",Under Implementation,820,2021,21-RR-COD-48131,27,Democratic Republic of the Congo,COD,3,Rapid Response,9,Cholera,Disease Outbreak,DR Congo RR Application Jun 2021 (Nyiragongo volcano),2,Biological (human disease outbreak and other health emergency),1,Natural Disaster,2,Middle Africa,2,Middle Africa,1,Africa,0,UNICEF;WHO,1197576,2021-06-17,2021-06-18,"On 22 May, the Nyiragongo volcano near the city of Goma in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) started erupting.

"On 24 March 2021, the town of Palma in Mozambique’s northern province of Cabo Delgado came under attack by non-state armed groups (NSAGs). In the days that followed, non-state armed groups and government security forces engaged in clashes, until the NSAGs eventually withdrew from the area.

"After experiencing delayed and erratic rainfall distribution in the previous Deyr season (October to December 2020), more than 50 districts in Somalia are suffering from the impact of drought-like conditions. According to a February 2021 assessment by the Somalia Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU), 1.6 million people were facing crisis or worse levels of food insecurity at that moment, with 1.45 million in IPC Phase 3 and 149,800 people in IPC Phase 4. Between December 2020 and April 2021, over 95,000 Somalis have been displaced as a result of the failed rainy season and forecasts project that by the end of 2021 at least 3.4 million people could be affected, with 380,000 expected to become displaced, by drought or drought-like conditions. The situation is comparable to 2017 when Somalia also suffered from extremely severe food insecurity following consecutive droughts. The impacts of the failed 2020 Deyr season add an additional layer of complexity to already unprecedented needs: At a time when communities are already struggling to cope with the impact of COVID-19, continued desert locust infestation, armed conflict and political instability, skyrocketing water prices, increased displacement and progressively widespread food insecurity, the drought-like conditions are driving communities to adopt negative coping mechanisms. The increasing and multisectoral needs of affected people are contrasted by diminished resources to provide assistance: In its second quarter of 2021, the humanitarian response plan remained severely underfunded at only 9.7 per cent.",Under Implementation,810,2021,21-RR-SOM-47079,74,Somalia,SOM,3,Rapid Response,8,Drought,Natural Disaster,Somalia RR Application Apr 2021 (Drought),3,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,1184154,IOM;UNFPA;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,7000046,2021-04-23,2021-05-03,"RAPID RESPONSE ALLOCATION: Delayed and erratic rainfall distribution characterized the October to December 2020 Deyr season, resulting in below-average, cumulative rainfall across most of the country. Pre-drought conditions, including widely depleted water reservoirs and shallow wells, loss of livestock, as well as extensive critical loss of pasture, have already been observed during a January 2021 inter-agency Drought Risk Assessment in Puntland, Somaliland, Galmudug and Jubaland: Only 19 per cent of the 1,250 assessed shallow wells contained water and 27 per cent of all assessed reservoirs were completely depleted. Subsequent assessments also identified dire water shortages in Hirshabelle. According to the post-Deyr season assessment from 4 February, 2021, 1.6 million people currently face crisis or worse levels of food insecurity as a result; up from 1.3 million in September 2020 and 1.1 million in January 2020; and comparable to 2017 when Somalia also suffered extremely severe food insecurity following consecutive droughts.

A second consecutive rainfall failure was expected to further exacerbate the humanitarian situation and food security experts therefore predicted that for the April to June 2021 period and beyond up to 2.65 million Somalis (21.5 per cent of the population) could face crisis or worse levels of food insecurity, including 400,000 likely to face emergency levels (3.2 per cent).",Under Implementation,811,2021,21-RR-SOM-47081,74,Somalia,SOM,3,Rapid Response,8,Drought,Natural Disaster,Somalia RR Application Apr 2021 (Anticipatory Action for drought),3,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,1184154,FAO;IOM;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,20001256,2021-04-26,2021-05-03,"ANTICIPATORY ACTION ALLOCATION: Beyond the current emergency, an even worse crisis is looming in the next months: Several climate forecasts predict the coming April-June rainfall season in Somalia to perform poorly as well.

These projected numbers of food insecurity surpass the trigger for the Somalia Anticipatory Action framework and the Emergency Relief Coordinator will therefore allocate up to an additional $20 million for anticipatory action to prevent such a severe deterioration of the situation. The AA allocation will leverage the pre-agreed action plan developed with different agencies to enable collective, timely, and adequate assistance in the face emerging needs. Notably, this is the second allocation for the anticipatory action framework in Somalia, demonstrating the concept is working and can reach scale. The AA allocation will complement the $7 million CERF RR and $13.3 million SHF allocations which seek to provide immediate support to communities already suffering severe water shortages, as a result of the poor October-December season. In addition, the up to $20 million AA allocation will assist those communities whose well-being, especially food security, is further threatened by the forecast poor March-June season. The joint AA and RR allocation show that the different humanitarian streams can work together and be complementary to achieve greater impact."

"Erratic rains in 2020 in the Southern and South-Eastern part of Ethiopia, coupled with the depletion of surface water sources and low groundwater level, led to severe water scarcity across pastoral and agropastoral areas of Somali and Oromia regions. Already in December 2020, some of the drought early warning triggers could be seen through anecdotal observation including poor performance of rain, reduced milk production, crop failure, shortage of quality and quantity of water for both humans and livestock, abnormal livestock migration with overcrowding in water sources, deterioration of livestock body condition, the high price of cereals and imported foods, lower price of livestock and reduced productivity. 
The initial assessments by humanitarian partners in 2021 indicated an increase in acute malnutrition as well as livestock in poor condition and communicable livestock disease. After the failed rains in 2020, the drought in 2021 is impacting 86 per cent of areas in Somali and 14 per cent of areas in Oromia. Since January 2021, the drought's devastating effects have been reported in 80 woredas (out of 93 woredas) in the Somali Region and 48 woredas in the Oromia Region (out of 335 woredas). According to the IPC projections for the period January-June 2021 (from December 2020), the nutrition situation in southern and southeastern areas will most likely deteriorate due to limited access to food (including milk) and income. Nutrition outcomes are expected to be most severe from February-July 2021, which is the typical Belg lean period. The latest FEWSNET update on Ethiopia (March 2021), southern and southeastern pastoral areas are facing a shortage of pasture and water as rainfall has yet to begin. The Somali region and adjacent areas of Oromia region are in IPC phase 3 (crisis) and projected to stay in that same condition until at least until September 2021. According to the IPC projections for the period January-June 2021 (from December 2020), the nutrition situation in southern and southeastern areas was likely to deteriorate due to limited access to food (including milk) and income. Nutrition outcomes were expected to be most severe from February-July 2021, which is the typical Belg lean period.The combination of these factors will contribute to food insecurity, which then increases malnourishment ahead of the coming long drier season

An estimated 5.8 million people are affected by the drought across the two regions, including 261,000 drought-induced IDPs in 186 sites. The drought is impacting 86% of areas in Somali and 14% of areas in Oromia, altogether affecting 128 of 428 woredas. The number of children admitted with severe acute malnutrition in the targeted woredas has increased by 70% in Somali and 7% in Oromia regions than the period before the drought. Furthermore, the reported incidence of gender-based violence, child labor, and child marriages has increased among drought-affected families. The current drought is being compounded by the socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, intercommunal conflicts, and the desert locust infestation.

"To avert humanitarian outcomes like those caused by the droughts of 2011, 2015/16 or 2017/18, humanitarian partners in Ethiopia in cooperation with government counterparts, in 2020, set up an Anticipatory Action (AA) framework for drought, which was endorsed by the Humanitarian Country Team on 28 October.
