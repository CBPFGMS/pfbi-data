"At the beginning of 2015, more than 233,000 Syrian refugees resided in the northern Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Intensified fighting in the northern Syrian town of Kobane at the end of 2014 triggered some 50,000 additional refugee arrivals to Iraq. The new influx put huge pressure on already overstretched humanitarian assistance as camp facilities and services were required to expand. Many of the new arrivals were women and children, some of whom had previously been displaced inside Syria or were refugees in Turkey. There was a critical need to strengthen protection and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) services, which struggled to address the large-scale needs. Public water and sanitation services were unable to meet the needs of growing refugee and host populations, leading to the failure of the water supply, sewage and wastewater treatment. Moreover, while 2.4 million conflict-affected people in Iraq required food assistance, the public food distribution system was disrupted due to fighting and insecurity.",Report Available,362,2015,15-UF-IRQ-13828,45,Iraq,IRQ,2,Underfunded Emergencies,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,15-UF-IRQ-13828_Iraq_Mar2015_Application,1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,14,Western Asia,15,Western Asia,3,Asia,235000,FAO;UNDP;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP,7988899.0000,2015-03-23,2015-04-02,Summary will be available soon.
"With the conflict in Syria entering its fifth year in 2015, Jordan was hosting 646,700 registered refugees (though estimates were putting the actual number of Syrians in Jordan at 1.4 million). The majority of refugees lived outside the camps in some of the country’s poorest areas. As Syrian refugees in Jordan have not been allowed to work, thus relying heavily on humanitarian assistance, they were increasingly unable to meet their basic needs. In addition, Palestinian refugees from Syria were extremely marginalized and subjected to the Government’s policy of non-admission, which placed them at constant risk of refoulement. Shrinking protection space and resources, including reductions in WFP food assistance and restrictions on access to health care for refugees living outside camps, resulted in a sharp increase in negative coping mechanisms.

With more than 30 per cent of the country’s population being refugees, nearly half of those most affected by the crisis were children and adolescents. The refugee influx placed huge pressure on the local economy, infrastructure and public services, causing severe humanitarian needs among refugees and host communities.

The aggressive campaign by non-state actors in Kunduz city and several other provincial centres (from Ghazni in the south to Maimana in the north) wreaked havoc, caused deaths and injuries, and provoked the widespread displacement of at least 16,800 families. The Kunduz regional airport, health facilities and schools were closed, while water, electrical and communication services were disrupted, which forced the evacuation of humanitarian personnel.

The crisis was followed by a devastating 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which struck the north and north-east of the country on 26 October. At least 15 provinces were affected, and 136,967 people needed humanitarian assistance.

For decades, Haitians have migrated to the Dominican Republic, attracted by a high demand for unskilled workers. An estimated 460,000 Haitian migrants without a regular immigration status resided in the Dominican Republic in 2015. The crisis was triggered by the Dominican Republic’s Presidential Decree concerning the National Plan, which granted the Dominican law-enforcement authority to forcibly expel people of Haitian descent who did not have newly imposed documentation.

"Madagascar experienced a long period of drought in 2015 and 2016, which led to significant losses in agricultural production and a slow-onset humanitarian emergency. A prolonged rain deficit caused large shortfalls in major food crops in the south, such as maize, cassava and rice. Apart from having a severe impact on livestock and agricultural production, the drought also caused a spike in the cost of water, resulting in an alarming decrease of water consumption among vulnerable communities. According to information collected by UNICEF, the price of 20 litres of water increased in 2016 from Ar200 to Ar1,400 in the most affected areas. As a result, the most vulnerable people in rural areas had to pay up to 28 times more for water than the people in urban areas.

The epidemic was declared in Angola in January 2016, and the first case in DRC was recorded at the Lufu border crossing on 28 February 2016. Subsequently, the number of reported cases in DRC continued to increase, leading the Ministry of Health to declare a yellow fever outbreak on 23 April 2016. By 23 June, 68 confirmed cases, 1,307 suspected cases and 75 deaths were reported. In total, 60 health zones in six provinces were affected, which is just over 10 per cent of the total number of health zones in DRC. There was a high risk of the epidemic spreading to other provinces and outside DRC. The porous border between Angola and DRC, as well as frequent cross-border population movements, largely contributed to the spread of the disease. The size of the epidemic and the scope of the required response far exceeded the sizes of yellow fever outbreaks in the past 10 years.

"El Niño induced a dire drought in Angola during the second half of 2015, affecting more than 1.5 million people in six provinces. The affected areas were populated by agropastoralist ethnic groups, who seasonally move their livestock from one grazing ground to another seeking water and pasture. The region has experienced drought conditions since the 2011/2012 agricultural season, marked by a combination of rainfall deficits, uneven rain distribution and dry spells. The 2015 El Niño-induced drought led to losses of food, seeds, livelihood assets and livestock (an estimated 360,000 heads of cattle), which further exacerbated the vulnerability of the rural population. In areas with agriculture potential, farmers lost draught animals used for ploughing the fields. The agricultural losses were estimated at 52,000 tons of crops, affecting 82 per cent of the rural population. As a result, approximately 800,000 people were considered food insecure in the three provinces of Cunene, Huila and Namibe.

This led to the loss of homes and livelihoods of evicted people, who became displaced among the local communities in surrounding areas. According to the population count carried out by OCHA, UNICEF, and international and local NGOs, 25,532 displaced people were located within host communities, in temporary shelters and in open spaces around the national park. The displaced people put further pressure on already weak social services and exacerbated intercommunity tensions.

"On 20 and 21 February 2016, Category 5 Tropical Cyclone Winston cut a path of destruction across Fiji. The storm directly affected approximately 350,000 people and was estimated to be one of the most severe storms to hit the South Pacific. Recognizing the severity of the disaster, the Government of Fiji requested international assistance on 22 February and declared a 30-day state of natural disaster. The widespread destruction of crops and loss of livestock had a devastating impact on food security, particularly among communities already struggling with the effects of El Niño. In Fiji’s western division, 43 out of 57 health centres were damaged. Based on estimates by assessment teams, 30,369 houses were damaged or destroyed. In the immediate aftermath of the cyclone, the Government opened 758 designated evacuation centres in all divisions. At their peak (26 February), the centres sheltered 62,000 people.

"As of April 2015, El Niño-induced drought began to severely impact rural areas in Papua New Guinea. By September 2015, many areas had only received 40 per cent of the average rainfall. Moreover, the reduced cloud cover associated with these dry conditions resulted in frosts at high altitudes. From April to August 2015, the growth of staple crops was stunted, while crops in high-altitude areas were destroyed. The communities replanted the crops in November and December, but intensive rains that followed led to the high rate of crop failure. The poor harvest that followed in January 2016 led to the depletion of available food reserves.

"In March 2017, the sudden intensification of conflict in Yemen, especially on the western coast, further worsened the already severe humanitarian situation. Large numbers of people in need were cut off from public services and humanitarian assistance. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) for the period March to July 2017, 10.2 million people in Yemen were in IPC phase 3 (crisis) and 6.8 million people were in IPC phase 4 (emergency). In May 2017, the Food Security and Nutrition clusters issued an alert warning that the food security and nutrition situation would deteriorate further in many areas across western Yemen. Urgent humanitarian interventions were needed to prevent IPC phase 4 areas slipping into famine (IPC phase 5) and to avert a severe deterioration in food consumption, malnutrition and mortality. 

The deteriorating food security situation was coupled with general worsening of the humanitarian conditions in Yemen. All parties to the conflict repeatedly violated their obligations under international humanitarian law. Increasing and continuous import restrictions for food, fuel and medicines led to bottlenecks which further aggravated the humanitarian needs. A disaster needs assessment estimated that infrastructure losses amounted to $19 billion. In May 2017, some 45 per cent of the country’s health facilities were not functioning and 10.4 million people lacked access to health services, clean water and sanitation.

"Mongolia experienced an intense dzud in 2015-2016 which was followed by a harsh summer drought in 2016 and severe winter weather in early 2017. Dzud is a cyclical slow-onset disaster unique to Mongolia, where a summer drought is followed by a severe winter with temperatures between -40 and -50 degrees Celsius, and a dry spring, during which the shortage of pasture and water leads to large-scale livestock loss. Dzud events heavily impact Mongolian herders for whom animals are often the only source of food, transport, heating materials and purchasing power. The Government estimated that 37,000 herder households were directly affected in 2017, of which 8,000 were left in critical need of humanitarian assistance. In addition, an outbreak of a deadly infectious animal disease towards the end of 2016 resulted in quarantine restrictions limiting the migration of herds in many northern locations of the country.

The lives of 782,000 children under age 5 and 313,629 pregnant and lactating women were particularly at risk. According to a joint assessment by UN agencies, 11 million people were directly affected by the drought. This led to a critical increase in malnutrition cases of children under age 5. The availability of clean water for drinking and hygiene was severely compromised. Hospitals and health clinics reported an increase in patients presenting diarrheal illnesses. Moreover, the drought decimated water reservoirs, wilted crops and dried rice paddy fields in five affected provinces: North and South Hwanghae, North and South Pyongan, and Nampo City. As of 23 June 2017, a total of 50,018 hectares of rice and maize fields were affected. Consequently, the average cereal ration of the Public Distribution System was reduced from 400 grams in June to 300 grams in July 2017.

"By 2017, prolonged insecurity due to years of Boko Haram-related violence had affected some 345,000 people in Chad, including 152,905 people who were internally displaced, and created widespread food insecurity. A needs assessment conducted in March 2017 predicted that more than 335,000 people would be food insecure and 146,000 people severely food insecure in the 2017 lean season. The nutritional situation deteriorated as well, with 18.1 per cent global acute malnutrition and 3.4 per cent severe acute malnutrition.

"After the unprecedented intercommunal violence of 2013 and 2014, presidential elections brought hope for stabilization in the Central African Republic (CAR) in 2016. However, during the course of 2016, eruptions of violence, armed clashes and human rights violations continued. By mid-2016, 40 per cent of CAR’s rural population were facing crisis and emergency levels of food insecurity as a result of conflict and displacement. In late 2016, a new wave of violence in south-east CAR forced thousands of people to flee their homes and seek shelter in host communities in the sub-prefectures of Bria, Bambari and Kaga-Bandoro. The influx of new internally displaced people (IDPs) put tremendous pressure on host communities, straining scarce resources and exacerbating an already fragile situation. In early 2017, critical food shortages were reported in these districts, which had already been experiencing high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition before the influx. Moreover, the 2016 Humanitarian Response Plan had been only 38 per cent funded, and as a result, WFP was running low on food stocks and was not able to cope with the rapidly rising needs.

Priority needs were identified as including food, shelter and bedding kits, healthcare and support for people with special needs such as the elderly and people with disabilities. A Humanitarian Response Plan for Burundi was developed to provide a coordinated response targeting 2.4 million vulnerable people, which assessed that UN humanitarian agencies and partners required $142 million in order to provide much-needed assistance in the food, nutrition, protection, health, water and sanitation sectors.

Between late March and June, more than 300,000 people were displaced, mainly in central and southern Somalia. The damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, and lack of adequate shelter made the affected population particularly susceptible to disease outbreaks. This was compounded by pre-existing vulnerabilities as the majority of communities in the affected regions were already facing an acute food security crisis – including as a result of months of intense drought that directly preceded the floods. It was anticipated, following reports from humanitarian partners and ongoing needs assessments, that the affected population would remain extremely vulnerable through September 2018 if humanitarian assistance were not rapidly scaled up; provision of food assistance, health services to mitigate disease outbreaks, shelter and other core relief items, and water and sanitation services were identified as priority needs.",Report Available,593,2018,18-RR-SOM-30443,74,Somalia,SOM,3,Rapid Response,6,Flood,Natural Disaster,Somalia RR Application May 2018 (Floods),3,Biological (human disease outbreak and other health emergency),1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,630000,UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,5133588.0000,2018-05-18,2018-05-22,Summary will be available soon.

Humanitarian needs far exceeded resources and capacities of host communities and the Zambian authorities. Access to services was further limited as the majority of refugees arrived at the Chiengi border area in Luapula Province, one of the poorest and most remote in Zambia.

"Since 2016, political and social instability, exacerbated by sporadic violence, has had a negative impact on civilians in Cameroon’s South-West and North-West regions. In November 2017, the socio-political crisis degenerated into insecurity and armed violence. Since then, the escalation of tension and upsurge in hostilities between non-state armed groups and defense and security forces have triggered humanitarian needs across the two regions owing to significant internal displacement. A rapid multi-sectoral assessment conducted by the UN agencies in March 2018 in the South-West and another conducted in April 2018 in the North-West region by Plan International showed that at least 160,000 people have been internally displaced in the two affected regions and need immediate humanitarian and protection assistance.",Report Available,609,2018,18-RR-CMR-31414,18,Cameroon,CMR,3,Rapid Response,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,Cameroon RR Application Aug 2018 (Displacement),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,2,Middle Africa,2,Middle Africa,1,Africa,160000,FAO;IOM;UN Women;UNDP;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,5096994.0000,2018-08-28,2018-08-31,Summary will be available soon.
"The humanitarian situation in the country was deteriorating in 2018 as a result of violence linked to Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin. The Far North region hosted nearly 242,000 Cameroonian internally displaced persons (IDPs) and 89,000 Nigerian refugees. The majority of the IDPs and around 30,000 refugees were hosted with local communities. The protection monitoring in 2017 indicated that IDPs, returnees and host communities had significant protection concerns and limited resources. More than 400,000 people from host communities were considered vulnerable and in need of immediate humanitarian assistance. In addition to the effects of the Boko Haram crisis, much of the population had limited access to the legal assistance, documentation, or basic social services, particularly in areas of return.  A total of 2.3 million people were food insecure and more than 180,000 in urgent need of immediate food aid. In addition, almost 160,000 children suffered from acute malnutrition in the country, including 44,700 from severe acute malnutrition (SAM). In the Far North region, global acute rates of malnutrition were 4.5 were per cent and an estimated 36,000 children aged 6-59 months required nutritional support. Only 14 per cent of the population had access to adequate hygiene and sanitation infrastructure and 54 per cent of the population did not have access to a water source. The crisis also increased the number of separated and unaccompanied children in the region, making children aged 5 to 14 vulnerable to all forms of gender-based violence and sexual violence.

Approximately 20,000 refugees arrived in Chad in March 2017, with subsequent waves following. As of 2018, continued violence and insecurity in CAR meant continued waves of refugees were expected to arrive, while those in the country were not expected to be able to return to Chad in the immediate future. These refugees arrived in Chad traumatized and with considerable protection and humanitarian needs. Most refugees were hosted by communities near the border where both host community members and refugees had limited access to food and basic social services such as health, education and access to water.

"Food insecurity was greatly compounded in Southern Chad in 2017/2018 following poor harvests due to lower than average rainfall throughout the Sahel. This was particularly acute in Southern Chad and compounded by crises caused by pests, such as locusts, cantharides, grain-eating birds and caterpillars. Official agricultural statics indicate that cereal production decreased by 5 per cent compared to the 2016/2017 period. Eight departments were found to have majority of residents in IPC-phase 3. This means having food consumption gaps that are reflected by high or above-usual acute malnutrition or being marginally able to meet minimum food needs but only by depleting essential livelihood assets or through crisis-coping strategies. A September 2017 Standardized Monitoring and Assessment of Relief and Transition indicated national rates of mild acute malnutrition of 13.9, slightly below the critical threshold set by WHO. According to forecast data, 167,253 children would have been affected by severe malnutrition in these regions in 2018.

"The humanitarian situation in Libya was heavily impacted by the political upheaval of 2011 and the social and economic consequences - including the disintegration of the country into territories where various political and military entities exercise authority. In 2018, when this CERF grant was provided, there were an estimated 1,400 militias in the country, with various fiefdoms where they controlled, among other things, access to basic services. The consequence of this division was an uneven availability of essential services to large segments of the population. Economically, a black market evolved where the Libyan Dinar was sometimes traded at levels that were three times higher than the official rate, leading to a cash liquidity crisis that had a very negative impact on Libyan’s ability to pay for services such as health care and education.

The root causes of the situation were armed conflict, the resulting displacement, the over-burdening of limited and generally deficient services in receiving host communities, lawlessness, human rights violations, uncontrolled migration, economic collapse, the deterioration of basic services (water, sanitation, health, cash liquidity, and markets) and political deadlock.

The agencies included in the CERF application (WASH and Health especially) were severely under-funded. For example, the protection sector - considered one of the most vital for the humanitarian response - was only 13 percent funded.

"In July 2018, the Libya’s Ministry of Health declared a measles outbreak. There was increasing concern to prevent further escalation of the outbreak, already in its 38th week, under which 591 cases were reported.  Prolonged conflict and lack of resources had made the population vulnerable to health shocks and epidemics and reduced response capacity. While the country was a high-middle income country before 2011, by 2018 17.5 per cent of public hospitals and 20 per cent of primary health care facilities in Libya were damaged and non-functional. Essential equipment, trained personnel and medicines were also severely lacking. Only 10 per cent of public health centres and 40 per cent of hospitals offered basic services. Only 1,897 of 4,275 official posts were filled and there were gaps of 4,997 nurses and 359 midwives. Vulnerability to health risks was heightened by malnutrition. In 2014, 6.5 per cent of children under age 5 were acutely malnourished (about 6,000 children), 3 per cent (200 children) severely acutely malnourished. Assessments further indicated that 21 per cent of children under 5 years of age (18,000 children), suffered from chronic malnutrition or stunting. Compounding this was increased migration of vulnerable groups. While Libya has traditionally been a migratory crossroads, mixed migration, including “children on the move”, asylum seekers, economic migrants, unaccompanied and separated children, environmental migrants, victims of trafficking and stranded migrants, increased by 33 per cent since 2014. By May 2019 there were an estimated 641,398 migrants in Libya, including almost 58,000 children, 20,000 of whom were separated or unaccompanied.

The first three cases were residents of Nigeria from Jibiya Local Government Area in Katsina State on the border with Nigeria. The cases, coming from the same family, reportedly had an onset of symptoms in Jibiya LGA before seeking treatment on 5 July 2018 at a health facility in a bordering town in Niger. Vibrio cholerae O1 Inaba was confirmed in stool samples from all three cases.

These areas were among the most affected districts during previous outbreaks with the last major outbreak reported in Niger in 2014 involving more than 2,000 cases. These areas were classified as high-risk areas for the spread of cholera given the presence of local risk factors such as poor hygiene and sanitary conditions coupled with large volumes of population movements and trade between these districts and neighbouring areas in Nigeria. With the ongoing rainy season and the increase in cases in the neighbouring Katsina State in Nigeria, the potential for further spread of the disease both within Niger and across the border with Nigeria was high.

"The Tillabery and Tahoua regions of Niger, on the border with Mali, have seen a progressive deterioration of the security situation since January 2018, resulting in significant waves of forced migration. The security situation was becoming increasingly volatile.  Non-state armed groups were increasing attacks and threats against civilians, leading to increasing displacement. Reports also indicated that cross-border military operations targeting these groups were contributing to an increased incidence of violence against civilians and displacement as armed groups moved across borders to evade military operations and hid among civilian populations, perpetrating violence against them. In addition, intercommunal violence among pastoralists, over cattle, land and water, was also intensifying and contributing to further destabilization of the region, leading to at least 276 reported killings. The two conflicts became intertwined as members of these communities joined non-state armed groups for protection and better access to resources. As a result of the growing insecurity, the number of refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs) in need of protection, water and sanitation, shelter and food assistance rose sharply. The number of displaced in Tillabery alone increased from 540 to 17,758, far exceeding the resources and capacities of the authorities and host communities. According to assessments conducted by local officials and UN and humanitarian partners in 2018, the displaced population of 17,758 was hosted by 103 highly-vulnerable border villages in Tillabery – with a combined population of 97,000.

Assessments of March 2018 showed a significant deterioration in food and nutritional security of households with the number of people in need of assistance having increased by more than 1 million people between the 2017 and 2018 lean season. Food insecurity was a particular concern with the number of people in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification phase 3 or 4 (“crisis” and “emergency” situation respectively) having doubled compared to the previous year. According to these projections, 932,651 people would have needed immediate assistance during the upcoming (June to September) agricultural lean season. Numerous conflicts between pastoralists and farmers in the transit and reception areas in central and northern Mali erupted at the start of the year and continued throughout the year. At the start of 2018, the rate of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) was 2.6 per cent and around 700,000 children suffered from acute malnutrition without access to adequate treatment.

"In 2017, Mauritania was facing an exceptional drought situation as a result of insufficient rainfall throughout the country. This led to a severe food and nutrition crisis as wells and water points dried out, agricultural production stagnated, and livestock died. Joint assessments conducted by the Government, UN agencies and partners confirmed the grave extent of the crisis and its impact on livestock, rainfed crops, crops pastures and coping mechanisms of communities. Food insecurity affected 1 million Mauritanians, representing 28 per cent of the population. The increased pressure on limited resources had especially worsened the nutritional situation of children; the global acute malnutrition rate for children aged 6 to 59 months rose to 10.9 per cent and the severe acute malnutrition rate almost doubled to 2.3 per cent.

"The migration from Venezuelans over recent years has been the largest in the modern history of Latin America and the Caribbean. The economic and political crisis – characterized by hyperinflation, low purchasing power and a severely limited access to basic goods and services – has generated a great number of refugees migrating to several countries in Latin America, principally to neighboring Colombia. Colombia and Peru are still the main destination for Venezuelans, Ecuador is increasingly becoming a destination country, apart from the main hub for transit of Venezuelans aiming to reach Peru or countries further south. According to Ecuadorian migration authorities, in 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 more than 1,135,000 Venezuelans had arrived in Ecuador with an estimated 30 per cent staying there. In response, the Government of Ecuador declared a State of Emergency in several border provinces.  
Rumichaca, one of two main border crossings, received the largest part of the population, with between 2,500 and 3,500 people arriving each day. The capacity of border officials to process the arrivals were strained, as well as local capacities to provide needed services and humanitarian services. Many Venezuelans were forced to stay at border crossings or in bus terminals for days on end on their way South, lacking information, proper shelter, needing food, medical assistance, relief items and facing various protection concerns including trafficking, robbery and sexual or labor exploitation.

"Venezuela’s political, social and economic situation has deteriorated over the last two years. The economic crisis is leading to triple digit monthly hyperinflation. Moreover, the loss of oil revenue and imposed economic sanctions have resulted in import reductions that are causing shortages of medical, food and other basic supplies. Production capacities have decreased in most economically productive industries and there is serious disruption of basic services (mainly electricity, water and transport), as a result, the population is facing severe challenges related to health, nutrition and protection.

A CERF allocation was needed to alleviate negative consequences of the crisis for the most vulnerable population. The main CERF activities were to contain the nutritional deterioration and to reduce its impact particularly on infants, pregnant and lactating women; to help ensure access to treatment and continuity of priority health programs; and to strengthen pre-existing protection networks.

This is the sixth allocation to the Venezuela mixed migratory crisis in 2018. Indeed, in response to the increase of the Venezuelan exodus into neighboring countries and beyond, the ERC allocated up to  $5.9 million to Colombia, $1.5 million to Brazil, $1.5 million to Ecuador, and $2 million to Peru.

Initially, the Government did not request assistance from the humanitarian community. The national authorities mobilized state resources to provide basic assistance to the affected populations. While the official partial damage assessment of the authorities as at 10 October 2018 showed 18 deaths, 548 wounded and nearly 11,134 families affected, these figures more than doubled as reports from the various municipalities reached the national level. At that point, the Government solicited support from national and international organizations.

"More than one year after Hurricane Matthew (2016), nearly 1 million people were still in need of some form of humanitarian assistance in Haiti in December 2017. The storm had destroyed over 100,000 homes and severely damaged an additional 100,000 according to the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment. Over 944,000 people were still in need of shelter assistance, including over 39,000 IDPs still living in 62 camps and settlements. This long-term displacement contributed to reliance on external assistance, exposed IDPs to natural hazards, and put them at risk of violence and exploitation. The situation was of particular concern in advance of the upcoming hurricane season as these residual needs had made the population particularly vulnerable.  Food insecurity was also high with 1.3 million people (18 per cent of the rural population) in food crisis (IPC phase 3) and over 132,000 people in a food stress (IPC phase 4). At least 792,000 people depended on agriculture, fishing or livestock assistance. Epidemics were also a major concern. In 2017, cholera was under control for the first time since the 2010 epidemic, thanks to strong and coordinated response, but continued and sustainably funded efforts were essential to sustain this success.

"The migration from Venezuelans over recent years has been the largest in the modern history of Latin America and the Caribbean. The economic and political crisis – characterized by hyperinflation, low purchasing power and a severely limited access to basic goods and services – has generated a great number of refugees migrating to several countries in Latin America, principally to neighboring Colombia. By November 2018 more than a million Venezuelan nationals were living in Colombia, according to official figures. This rose to 1.2 million by February 2019 and was expected to reach 2 million by the end of 2019. In addition, authorities estimated over 500,000 Colombians returned to the country; this figure likely underestimates the number as the proportion of unregistered migrants is significant. These arrivals face insecurity and have significant protection and humanitarian needs. Inter-agency assessments found critical humanitarian needs in the border areas for lifesaving activities in the sectors of health, food assistance, water and sanitation, education, protection and shelter. At least four categories of population were affected each presenting specific vulnerabilities and needs: Venezuelan families coming to live in Colombia or to transit south America bound; Colombian returnees or mixed families; indigenous groups that inhabit ancestral territories, on both sides of the border; and Colombian host-communities. Joint assessments carried out by IOM, UNHCR and WFP found significant needs in health nutrition, protection, water and sanitation sectors. In the area 75 per cent of Colombian-Venezuelan families, 66 per cent of Venezuelans families and 42 per cent of Colombian returnees lacked access to health care. More than 90 per cent of infants and children under 2 years of age were not breastfeeding, as 98 per cent of breastfeeding women were not receiving food supplements. Around 46 per cent of households interviewed do not have access to sanitation and water supply systems. More than one third of the households do not have access to formal education.

"In 2018, the situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) was impacted by a protracted humanitarian crisis, including limited access to basic life-saving services, food insecurity and undernutrition. In this context, humanitarian agencies’ ability to the population’s humanitarian needs was severely hampered by a sharp decline in funding, placing the lives of the most vulnerable further a risk. 
 
In the realm of health, disease was major concerns. Much of the country lacked sufficient health facilities and essential medical equipment or medicines to provide quality health services. There were disparities in access to services between rural and urban areas, demonstrated by under-five mortality rates, which were 1.2 times higher in rural areas than urban areas. The country had one of the highest rates of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) in the world. The withdrawal of funds by the Global Fund for the treatment of multi drug-resistant tuberculosis left a critical gap in the country with only 2,400 out of 4,600 new cases receiving treatment. While the funding from the Global Fund provided earlier in 2018 allowed the procurement of drugs to treat ‘normal’ TB, there was a major gap in funds for the provision of treatment for MDR TB, which is more serious, more complicated and more expensive to treat. 
 
Chronic and widespread malnutrition and inadequate water, health and sanitation compounded health related issues. According to the 2017 Global Hunger Index, DPRK has a score of 28.2, which is classified as ‘serious’. Around 10.3 million people, or 41 per cent of the total population, are undernourished. An estimated 20 per cent of children are stunted and 3 per cent suffer from wasting. According to the 2017 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, almost 40 per cent of households are drinking contaminated water.

"In 2017, over 353,000 civilians were displaced from Marawi City and other municipalities in Lanao del Sur by five months of armed conflict between the Government of the Philippines and a local non-state ISIS-inspired armed group. When the conflict ended in October 2017 it had left 24 of Marawi City’s 96 barangays uninhabitable – almost the entire commercial district. As many as 60,000 of the city’s 201,000 residents were impacted. Evacuation centers and host communities were overstretched as 94 per cent of the displaced were unable to return to their homes. Social service delivery, utilities, housing, and residents’ livelihoods were severely affected in the municipalities around Lake Lanao. In addition, Typhoon Tembin caused floods and landslides in December 2017. Reconstruction efforts faced significant challenges including mines and unexploded ordnance, as well as the sheer magnitude of destruction. Further complicating the situation was the extension of martial law, imposed by the Philippine Government for the Island of Mindanao at the outbreak of the conflict.

"The humanitarian crisis in Yemen remains the worst in the world. Conflict and severe economic decline since 2014 are driving the country to the brink of famine and increasing humanitarian suffering. Since November 2017, the blockade on air and seaports and the escalation of the conflict on Yemen’s western coast have led to increased humanitarian needs in all sectors. In early 2018, the Yemen Humanitarian Needs Overview indicated an estimated 80 per cent of the population – some 22.2 million people – require some form of humanitarian or protection assistance, including 11.3 million who are in acute need. About 12.9 million people needed assistance to protect their safety, dignity or basic rights, from violations of international humanitarian law, grave violations of children’s rights or gender-based violence. Some 2.6 million new internally displaced people (IDPs) currently needed shelter, while an estimated 14.1 million children were out of school due to the conflict. Around 17.8 million people were classified as food insecure, of whom 8.4 million were severely food insecure, 1.2 million pregnant and lactating women were at risk of acute malnutrition and 1.8 million children were acutely malnourished, including 400,000 children under age of 5 years suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Some 16 million people lacked adequate access to clean water and sanitation.

"The 2018 drought – a result of the La Niña phenomenon associated with reduced rain and snowfall levels left more than 9.9 million people food insecure. The situation of water supply and sanitation in Afghanistan I sone of the poorest in the world with more than 36 per cent of the population living without access to improved safe water sources and 47 per cent still using unimproved sanitation facilities. Afghanistan has had the highest number of recorded landmine and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW) casualties for two years running. In 2018, approximately 120 people per month were killed or injured by landmines, ERW and/or landmines of an improvised nature, also known as Victim Operated Improvised Explosive Devices, pressure-plate improvised explosive devices. According to the 2018 Protection Analysis of Conflict Affected Populations (PACAP) report, 52 per cent of displaced households indicated the presence of explosive hazards in their places of origin. Roughly 46 per cent of displaced households in the south of Afghanistan reported encounters with explosive hazards during displacement, either on the move or at displacement locations. Further, UNMAS Afghanistan recorded a total of 10,957 mine action casualties from 2011 until July 2019. Twenty-four per cent of these casualties occurred in the five provinces selected for this intervention: Kunduz, Baghlan, Uruzgan, Helmand and Nangarhar; 50 per cent of these casualties were children. According to UNMAS data, mine action casualties in the five provinces were caused by landmines of an improvised nature 57 per cent of the time and ERW 40 per cent of the time.   Afghanistan’s under-developed health system is thinly spread across the country, due to ongoing conflict and insecurity, as well as infrastructure challenges. Around 30 per cent of the population has limited access to basic health services within a 2-hour travel radius and maternal mortality is among the highest in the world. Only 50 per cent of children under five have received the full suite of recommended vaccinations to keep them safe and healthy. The fragile health system is further overburdened by mass casualty incidents and recurrent outbreaks of communicable diseases, especially among IDPs. It is anticipated that 50 per cent of people in Afghanistan are suffering from some form of psychological distress and some 20 per cent of the population is impaired in his or her role due to mental health issues. Traditional barriers hinder many from having mental disorders diagnosed and from seeking appropriate services. There is also limited mental health training among health personnel leaving many sufferers to live with their conditions without support.The nutritional situation in Afghanistan continued to be alarming. Ongoing conflict, low access to basic services, and the impact of natural disasters have exacerbated the already existing vulnerabilities of communities, contributing towards high rates of acute malnutrition. According to the nutrition surveys in 2019, 22 out of 34 provinces were above the emergency level threshold of acute malnutrition based on WHO classification of wasting rates for children under the age of five (global acute malnutrition (GAM) ≥10 per cent with aggravating factors). The impact of drought in 2018 which extended through 2019, further aggravated the poor nutritional situation. The nutritional status of children under five continues to deteriorate in most parts of Afghanistan, directly threatening their lives. This partly stems from the surge in food insecurity over recent years, including as a result of the 2018/19 drought, but also because of chronic issues.",Report Available,691,2019,19-UF-AFG-38544,8,Afghanistan,AFG,2,Underfunded Emergencies,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,Afghanistan UF Application Sep 2019 (Displacement),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,10,Southern Asia,13,Southern Asia,3,Asia,6300000,IOM;UNHCR;UNICEF;UNOPS;WFP;WHO,15999997.0000,2019-09-23,2019-09-24,Summary will be available soon.

"Heavy rainfall in July 2019 has triggered the worst floods in 20 years in Bangladesh, affecting over 7.6 million people in 28 out of 64 districts along the country’s two major river systems. By mid-August, the floods had claimed 119 lives, damaged nearly 600,000 houses and displaced over 300,000 people. Over 1,500 km of embankments were washed away, leading to prolonged flooding and extensive loss of agricultural livelihoods including $112 million worth of crops and $83 million worth of livestock and poultry. While the Government and humanitarian partners began immediate response through provision of emergency shelter, food packages, cash grants, etc., significant needs remained unaddressed. Further rains and upstream water flow were feared to aggravate the flood situation, exposing the affected communities to greater health and protection risks.

"According to the Salvadoran Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN), from 2012 to 2015 El Salvador suffered four consecutive droughts that generated agricultural losses up to $218.8 million. 2016 and 2017 were years of partial recovery for smallholder farmers. However, in 2018 El Salvador experienced the longest dry period for 48 years and this occurred at the most critical phase of the first crop cycle. This was followed by extremely heavy rains during the second and last crop cycle that further exacerbated the situation. Consequently, the General Directorate of Civil Protection issued an orange alert for 12 departments and red alert for 143 municipalities due to extreme weather drought. In response to the severe drought and declaration of Red Alerts, the government activated its national response mechanisms and immediately requested WFP, FAO and UNICEF to carry out an Emergency Food Security Assessment (EFSA). The results revealed that 98,783 subsistence farmers’ households (493,915 people) were heavily affected by the drought, of which 85% are completely dependent on agricultural activities. The assessment highlighted that 42,000 families (210,000 people) would be food insecure as of January 2019, month in which it was estimated that their food reserves would be exhausted and require urgent assistance. In addition, the analysis of the Integrated Classification by Phases of Food Security (IPC) projected that from April to July 2019, 5% (63,000 people) of the affected population will be in the emergency phase, 17% (239,000 people) in crisis phase and 34% (472,000 people) in stress phase.",Report Available,678,2019,19-RR-SLV-37678,32,El Salvador,SLV,3,Rapid Response,8,Drought,Natural Disaster,El Salvador RR Application Jun 2019 (Drought),3,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",1,Natural Disaster,6,Latin America and the Caribbean,8,Central America,2,Americas,3900000,FAO;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,1998859.0000,2019-07-11,2019-07-11,Summary will be available soon.
"Honduras has been facing chronic drought and prolonged dry spells for five consecutive years, a situation which further exacerbated by El Niño. The humanitarian situation along Honduras’ dry corridor reached crisis levels in August 2018, with more than 850,000 people facing food insecurity and requiring humanitarian assistance. The production losses of basic grains in the first 2018 cycle was greater than 70 per cent for more than half of the producers in the Dry Corridor, with more than 75 per cent of households losing their food reserves. A food security assessment carried out late in 2018 identified 525,000 people affected by various levels of food insecurity and with 40 per cent of households having a decreased quantity of water compared to the same time of the year in 2017. These factors place people at risk of water-borne diseases. After the Honduran Council of Ministers declared a state of emergency in 12 departments, the Government, with the support of the Humanitarian Country Team, developed an action plan to respond to the immediate needs of 65,500 food insecure households in 74 municipalities of Honduras over a 6-month period.

"The humanitarian situation in the Venezuela was deteriorating, resulting in the displacement of over 5 million migrants and refugees since 2015. Political and socioeconomic instability in Venezuela had contributed to widespread unemployment, reports of human rights violations, growing insecurity and challenges in ensuring access to basic commodities, such as food and medicine, forcing a large number of Venezuelans to leave their country. Migrants and refugees from Venezuela moved into surrounding countries, stretching capacities of host governments, particularly in border areas with high populations of Venezuelans, and increased pressure on already overburdened local services. According to August 2019 figures, 1,408,055 Venezuelan migrants and refugees were hosted in Colombia , 853,429 in Peru ,  330,414 in Ecuador, and 178,575 in Brazil. The pressure on limited resources has resulted in a rise in xenophobia, generating more frequent incidents aimed at foreigners.  According to IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) reports, children (25.5 per cent of the surveyed population), pregnant women (6.4 per cent of the surveyed population), the elderly (0.9 per cent of the surveyed population), as well as people with chronic diseases or disabilities (9 per cent of the surveyed population) were among the most vulnerable. In addition, UNHCR has noted high levels of unaccompanied and separated children (UASC) among the Venezuelan migrant and refugee population. Through the DTM and local assessment as well as coordination with stakeholders, IOM and UNHCR identified the following needs a) large concentrations of Venezuelans at border points and in other receiving areas with poor reception conditions increased the vulnerabilities of people on the move; b) public structures and resources at the local level in recipient countries became insufficient to cope with the immediate protection, shelter, food and non-food items (NFI) needs; c) the capacities of the migration and asylum authorities to manage the high demand for documentation and regular status was overstretched, including instances of statelessness due to a lack of jus soli when Venezuelan children are born d) individuals and families arrived in extremely vulnerable conditions and with significantly reduced resilience and self-sufficiency; e) as a result, partially of the aforementioned points but also of stricter legislation, the intensified use of unsafe land routes poses increasing threats to the life and dignity including smuggling, Trafficking in Persons (TiP), Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV),  child protection risks including child labour, begging, sexual exploitation, recruitment by criminal gangs, involvement in illegal activities and early marriage and LGBTI risks and vulnerabilities of Venezuelans on the move.  The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic added yet another layer to the challenges faced by Venezuela and neighboring countries. As COVID-19 cases rapidly spread through the region, many countries imposed strict lockdown measures, including restriction of movement and curfews; many migrants and refugees lost their sources of income and were unable to secure money for food, housing, and health care. The regional interagency coordination platform (R4V), co-led by IOM and UNHCR, launched a revised version of the Regional Refugee and Migrant Response Plan 2020 (RMRP), adapted to the changing landscape following COVID-19.

In the aftermath of the cyclone, an interagency assessment was conducted together with the Government in affected areas, which found that maize, rice, chestnut and vegetable crops were damaged and up to 60 per cent of soybean production had been destroyed in the storm. The cyclone compounded a situation in which storms and successive poor rains had led to severe chronic malnutrition and food insecurity among communities. Around 40 per cent of the population in the DPRK was food insecure and in need of emergency assistance, and one in five children under the age of five was chronically malnourished.

Nonetheless, the limited extension of state authority in areas left by the FARC has encouraged territorial disputes between non-state armed groups that seek to control areas with a presence of illicit crop cultivation and which serve as logistical corridors for trafficking. In addition, the humanitarian impact of persistent armed actions, natural disasters and challenges in access to basic goods and services by vulnerable segments of the population, have coincided with increasing numbers of Venezuelan migrants and refugees arriving to many areas of the country.

"The cholera epidemic started in Haiti in 2010, resulting in a significant humanitarian and health crisis, with over 800,000 suspected cases and over 9,700 deaths reported between 2010 and 2018. In 2013, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population developed and implemented the National Plan for the Elimination of Cholera, supported by UN humanitarian agencies and partners – with the overall goal of ending the epidemic by 2022. Thanks to a strategy of surveillance, rapid response, coordination and community engagement, the epidemic was on a downward trend, despite some short but localized outbreaks. Since 2016, the annual number of suspected cases and deaths had been steadily declining. The objectives of the medium-term phase of the plan were attained by 2018 with an annual incidence of cholera of 0.03 per cent – below the plan’s objective of less than 0.1 per cent. In 2018, only 3,786 suspected cases and 41 deaths were reported:  a respective decrease of 72 per cent and 74 per cent since the peak of the epidemic in 2011, and the lowest annual incidence since the start of the epidemic. The situation continued to improve, and by early February 2019 ‘zero confirmed cases’ was achieved. However, despite the overall decrease in cases, localized outbreaks continued to be reported in several areas of cholera persistence. Risks remained as a result of surveillance gaps and cross-border cholera cases.

"In 2019, Haiti was affected by drought which led to a significant decline in agricultural production and loss of income for rural households. Throughout 2018, Haiti experienced a rapidly deteriorating political and economic situation, which took a turn for the worse in 2019, severely reducing the average income and purchasing power of Haitian households, especially the most vulnerable. Civil unrest continued throughout 2019, with increasing levels of violence, impacting public and private provision of essential services. In addition, Haiti is highly vulnerable to climate shocks.  Haiti was identified by the 2019 Climate Risk Index as the fourth most affected country by climate events in the period 1998-2017. In 2019, the rainfall deficit led to a new year of drought and the further deterioration of living standards for the most vulnerable people, particularly those whose livelihoods were linked to agriculture. In this context, the country experienced drought 2018, which led to a significant decline in agricultural production and loss of income for rural households. This contributed to increased food insecurity and malnutrition among already vulnerable communities. The October 2019 Food Security Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) exercise found that during the hunger gap period of March-June 2019, 2.6 million Haitians living in rural areas were reported to be food insecure (IPC phases 3 and 4), representing about 38 per cent of the rural population. 1.05 million people were in the emergency phase 4 (of which 207,000 in urban settings) and 2.63 million in the crisis phase 3 (of which 649,000 in urban settings).

"In 2019, Haiti faced a serious humanitarian situation as a result of both chronic and acute factors. The country has suffered the impact of several major natural disasters over the past decades and faces profound and multi-dimensional poverty, ranking 169th of 189 countries on the 2019 Human Development Index, with one quarter of its population living below the extreme poverty line. Levels of chronic food insecurity are among the highest in the world, with more than half of the population of 10.9 million chronically food insecure. This was exacerbated further by the El Niño phenomenon in the first half of 2019, which created a drought and a 12.3 per cent drop in agricultural production, and the ongoing political crisis and civil unrest, both of which significantly decreased food availability. The October 2019 Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) exercise showed a significant deterioration of the food security and nutritional situation of rural and urban households in the country, with 3.7 million people facing acute food insecurity with 1 million people facing emergency levels of food insecurity between the months of October 2019 and February 2020. From March to June 2020, the number of people facing acute food insecurity was projected to increase to 4.1 million, including an estimated 1.2 million people likely to face emergency levels of food insecurity. A February 2020 survey showed increases in national rates of malnutrition for children rising above emergency thresholds: with national rates of global acute malnutrition rates rising to 6 per cent, national rates of Moderate Acute Malnutrition 3.9 per cent, and national rates of Severe Acute Malnutrition to 2.1 per cent. In September 2019, a phase of almost complete lockdown of the country started due to civil unrest, which hampered or halted humanitarian operations while humanitarian needs increased. Everyday life came to a standstill and affected and public and private sector’s supply chain’s and capacity to provide essential services were limited. Hospitals, civil protection units and other emergency services were functioning with limited capacity due to fuel shortages, lack of safe water and other essential items.

"In 2018 Guatemala was affected, for the sixth consecutive year, by a prolonged heat wave associated with the El Niño phenomenon that directly impacted subsistence farmers and indirectly agricultural day laborers. In late 2018, WFP and UNICEF carried out an Emergency Food Security Assessment (EFSA), including specific items related to acute malnutrition in children under 5 and women. Overall, the EFSA’s results estimated that around 36% of the Guatemalan population were suffering moderate to severe food insecurity which, considering rural poverty as a crucial factor of vulnerability, has resulted in around 3 million people subject to food insecurity. The four states with the highest food insecurity levels were Alta Verapaz (80.5%), Quiché (58.1%), Quetzaltenango (58%) and Sololá (54%).


The food insecurity situation was a result of an extended dry spell, lasting up to 50 days at a time, which happened in the middle of the rainy season of 2018. That resulted in harvest losses up to 75% for maize and beans affecting around 300,000 households. Alternative income sources for affected family members were not available since labour for coffee and cardamom harvests was limited.

In Alta Verapaz, 800,000 people (160,000 families) were identified to be in-need of food assistance, including around 225,000 children under 5.

"After the request for CERF funds made in August 2019, the political and economic crisis in Venezuela continued to deepen, with serious humanitarian consequences for its population. As noted in the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview and in the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan with Humanitarian Needs Overview, the humanitarian situation in Venezuela is the result of seven consecutive years of economic contraction, episodes of hyperinflation, political polarization and institutional challenges. Official figures from the Central Bank of Venezuela in 2020 indicate an economic contraction of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of more than 53 per cent in the last six years. Household income, savings and consumption all declined. Public spending, including significant investment in social programmes and the ability to import and market goods and ensure essential services, have also been affected. While the Government has made efforts to maintain social protection programmes, the situation has negatively impacted the living conditions of the most vulnerable people, particularly in terms of their access to food, medicines and medical treatment. The functionality of infrastructure and essential services including water, electricity, domestic gas, fuel and transport was been affected. In addition, and as a coping mechanism, the situation led to considerable human mobility as people search for better living conditions and access to basic services and/or protection. People are moving both internally towards border, mining and urban areas, as well as to other countries.

Over 7 million people were estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance. More than 21 per cent of the population – some 6.8 million people – were estimated to be suffering from undernourishment. Some 2.4 million were estimated to be severely food insecure. Communicable diseases such as measles and malaria have resurfaced. School dropouts were estimated to affect more than 856,000 children and adolescents. Many families resorting to negative coping mechanisms such as selling assets, taking children out of school to contribute to family income, or leaving children behind when migrating to other countries. The COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated pre-existing humanitarian needs and has impacted the provision of essential services like healthcare and water, gas and electricity supply.

"Niger faces a variety of threats, including climate change, floods, and seasonal epidemics, as well as demographic growth and cross-border violence. In 2019 insecurity and armed violence severely continued to disrupt basic social services and national development efforts, severely impacting the civilian population. The humanitarian situation in Diffa was particularly acute, where the Lake Chad Basin crisis and attacks by Boko Haram and clashes with the Nigerian national army led to the displacement of millions. The region has been under a state of emergency since 2015 as a result of violent attacks, looting and threats by non-state armed groups. The situation in Liptako-Gourma, Tahouam and Tillaberi regions also worsened due to the proliferation of non-state armed groups, inter-community conflict and violent extremism. In Tahoua and Tillaberi regions, 13 departments (two in Tahoua and 11 in Tillaberi) have been placed under a state of emergency due to growing insecurity. In addition, the country faces significant humanitarian needs in part due to drought and insecurity in agricultural and pastoral areas. According to the 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview, more than 2.3 million people needed humanitarian assistance. The National Nutrition Survey conducted in October 2018, estimated the national prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition as 15.0 per cent, and chronic malnutrition at 47.8 per cent, far above the critical threshold of 40 per cent. In addition, more than 990,000 people required basic health assistance.

The 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview identified that key humanitarian needs in Libya were linked to protection, access to critical services such as health care, education, safe drinking water and sanitation, and access to basic household goods and commodities such as food and essential non-food items. The early part of 2019 saw increasing need as populations were directly and indirectly affected by the resurgence of conflicts in Tripoli and the South, particularly Murzuq, and other locations throughout Libya. However, due to the unpredictable security situation on the ground, humanitarian actors had only limited access to Libya; this became acute when an evacuation status was put in place following an escalation of the conflict. In February 2018, the evacuation order was lifted, giving humanitarian actors a vital opportunity to be consistently present in Libya, and to increase provision of essential services and life-saving protection assistance.

"Significant economic deterioration and price rises in Sudan in 2018 and 2019 had a major humanitarian impact. According to recently published analysis, 5.7 million people were estimated to be in crisis (IPC 3) or emergency (IPC 4) levels of food insecurity in the October-December 2018 period – which was up from 3.8 million for the same period of 2017. Despite a relatively good harvest, these high levels are driven by food prices that have more than doubled in the past year, and the price of the staple crop sorghum is more than 230 per cent above the five-year average. Many people whose levels of food assistance were reduced due to improving livelihoods – including internally displaced people and refugees – were again in need of greater assistance. The crisis continued, with the inflation rate reaching 73 per cent in December 2018 with huge fluctuation in 2019 due to the ongoing political instability and the declaration of state of emergency across the country. This had a direct implication on household nutrition security. Some people adopted negative coping mechanisms. Lack of cash availability also impacted many constructions-related activities or the informal labour market. Vulnerable populations, e.g., internally displaced people and refugees living in urban camps, have been particularly hit as many of them rely on informal markets.  

Beyond food insecurity, the economic crisis had a serious impact on all humanitarian sectors in Sudan. Higher prices for food baskets, which have typically accounted for half of household income, took up more than 65 per cent of household expenditure among internally displaced people and refugees. Households were able to afford less nutritious food, less medical treatment, or fewer agricultural inputs. With fewer resources, negative coping mechanisms like selling of household assets and cutting of trees for charcoal production have increased, with implications for protection risks, particularly gender-based violence. Clinical management of rape is still weak, and the increased potential for gender-based violence and harmful coping strategies of vulnerable communities required immediate attention.",Report Available,650,2019,19-RR-SDN-35023,76,Republic of the Sudan,SDN,3,Rapid Response,35,Economic Disruption,Unspecified Emergency,Sudan RR Application Mar 2019 (economic crisis and food insecurity),5,Conflict-related,0,,3,Northern Africa,3,Northern Africa,1,Africa,5700000,FAO;IOM;UNFPA;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,26362821.0000,2019-04-02,2019-04-16,Summary will be available soon.

According to WHO, close to 23 million people were at risk in the eight states of Sennar, Blue Nile, Gederef, Gezira, Kassala, Khartoum, White Nile and River Nile. In addition, Sudan hosts a significant number of refugees from South Sudan in some of these affected locations which were characterized by an already strained economy as well as limited resources and services, thus, amplifying the risk of further spread of cholera among the refugee communities.

"During the first half of 2019, Sudan’s humanitarian needs have continued to grow. The ongoing economic crisis, at that time, has been exacerbated by months of civil unrest and political uncertainty. Based on revised intersectoral vulnerability analysis, some 8.5 million people are estimated to be in need humanitarian or protection assistance. 
The deepening economic crisis that started in 2018 made more people vulnerable. About 5.8 million people were estimated to be in crisis (IPC 3) or emergency (IPC 4) levels of food insecurity based on March-May 2019 projection – up from 3.8 million at the start of 2018. Despite a relatively good harvest, these high levels of food insecurity were driven by higher production costs and food prices that have more than doubled in 2018. Overall, prices were expected to remain between 30 - 40 per cent above previous year and over 300 per cent above the five-year average. Small-scale farmers were facing increased restrictions, including the availability of, and accessibility to inputs such as machinery, tools, seeds, essential veterinary supplies and feed supplements and fertilizers, due to high and increasing inflation rates. In addition, restricted access to land due to access denial by armed groups and tribal conflict, triggered by political instability, caused a reduction in the planted areas in the Darfur States.

The rainy season underway was predicted to be above normal with floods in several parts of the country such as North and South Darfur increasing the risk of disease outbreaks, including acute watery diarrhoea, particularly in areas where people have limited access to water and sanitation facilities and with limited health infrastructure. 
Protection risks were multiplying. Darfur was of concern due to increased intercommunal tensions and harassment of IDPs including women and girls with GBV continuing to be a major area of concern. Armed tribes were increasingly attacking farmers, including IDPs and intimidating them from farming. Between the June and August 2019 planting season displaced women and girls were at increased risk of sexual violence as they move out of camps to access their farms. Fighting between non-state armed groups was expected to lead to further displacement.

Rising tensions with host communities had introduced new protection concerns for refugees. For example, in June, several host community attacks on South Sudanese refugees in Khartoum led to the new displacement of about 7,000 refugees who were forced to flee their homes, seeking safety in other parts of Khartoum and in refugee camps in White Nile.

"Since 2013, the newly independent South Sudan has faced years of internal conflict that has forced almost 4 million people to flee their homes in search of safety, nearly 1.5 million of them within the country and more than 2.2 million outside the country as refugees. At the time of the allocation, communal violence, combined with small-arms proliferation and weak rule of law, were evident. Cattle raiding remains a widespread practice in South Sudan, but one that is increasingly politicized and linked to broader conflict and insecurity. The extended instability in South Sudan has eroded the Government’s ability to provide consistent basic services to its people. At the time of the allocation, a general decrease in fighting led to improved humanitarian access, with movement by road, river and air improving in areas of return. 

As a result of these changes, people in Protection of Civilian sites (PoCs), collective centres, and spontaneous settlements across South Sudan wanted to return to their places of origin. IOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) reports that South Sudan saw significant and increasing numbers of returnees in the first three months following the signing of a peace agreement as of September 2018. As of 19 July 2019, at least 534,082 individuals had returned to their places of origin, with the number of returnees per month averaging 96,278 people for both refugee and IDP returnees.

IDP returnees faced significant challenges. Over half of returnees lived in inadequate housing, such as makeshift shelters or partially damaged housing. Many did not have access to land or property. IDP returnee communities included vulnerable groups with specific needs, including children and women at risk, the elderly, people with disabilities, single-headed household members, and the extremely poor. There was a significant need to help IDP returnees integrate into communities of origin, as in the short to medium term their presence created additional pressures on and competition with host communities over food, livelihoods or shelter. Compared to non-displaced populations, their coping mechanisms were also largely exhausted.

"The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is still grappling with the world’s second largest Ebola epidemic on record, more than a year since the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reported the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu province, the 10th Ebola outbreak in DRC since the virus was first discovered in 1976. The response efforts have been complicated by the ongoing conflict which exacerbates the risks and makes it more complex to prevent and treat the disease. It is estimated that over one million people are internally displaced in the affected areas of DRC and the epicentre of the outbreak is a target for non-state armed actors, resulting in challenges due to insecurity and community resistance.
As of 16 October 2019, about 3,224 EVD cases (link) had been reported in DRC, of which 2,152 died (case fatality ratio 67.1 per cent). The risk of the EVD spreading into the neighbouring countries remains high. In neighbouring states, three cases of Ebola have been confirmed in Uganda as of June 2019 and there are unsubstantiated reports of suspected cases in Tanzania.

"Uganda hosted the largest refugee population in Africa, with over 1.2 million refugees as of December 2018. Existing refugee populations and continuing new arrivals put enormous pressure on the country’s resources. Acute needs remained in protection, food assistance, shelter, health and nutrition, WASH and emergency livelihoods. Deteriorating security, political instability, gross human rights abuses and protection concerns in neighboring countries drove people to seek safety and security in Uganda throughout 2019, with 155,000 new arrivals expected in 2019, the majority from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Humanitarian partners have been overstretched and resources have not been sufficiently able to meet the scale of need in some sites, causing a deterioration in existing refugee and hosting community settlements. Communities shared limited resources and struggled to cope with additional new daily arrivals.

According to the November 2018 projection of the Integrated Food Insecurity Classification Framework (IPC), two districts of the Great South (Beloha and Ampanihy), were classified in the “Emergency” phase for the period from November 2018 to March 2019 several pockets of emergency in the other districts. Around 890,000 people were in the “Emergency” and “Crisis” phase, of whom 460,000 required an immediate intervention. In addition, assessments indicated that as of the last quarter of 2018, 22 of 146 municipalities were in a nutritional emergency (with the majority concentrated in the district of Ampanihy), with an additional 18 others in nutritional alert. The country also faced a measles outbreak; as of February, 8 2019, 59,699 cases had been registered and 676 cases confirmed. The epidemic had affected 22 regions (100 per cent) of the country, with 581 deaths recorded and investigated. National measles vaccine coverage was only 58 per cent and a rate of 1,088 cases per million inhabitants indicated a rapid evolution of the epidemic in the community. The population was particularly vulnerable to the outbreak in the Great South, where the most vulnerable children were already weakened by the food and nutritional insecurity crisis, the average vaccination rates were among the lowest in the country (between 30 to 43 per cent) and 73 per cent of the population live more than 5 kilometres from a health centre.",Report Available,646,2019,19-UF-MDG-34350,55,Madagascar,MDG,2,Underfunded Emergencies,27,Multiple Emergencies,Multiple Emergencies,Madagascar UF Application Feb 2019 (Drought and Measles),6,Internal strife,3,Multiple,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,19728130,FAO;UNDP;UNFPA;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,4998919.0000,2019-02-21,2019-03-12,Summary will be available soon.
"In late 2017, inter-communal conflicts surged in Ethiopia leading to the displacement of 3.2 million people. Children accounted for 59 per cent of the displaced population in the country. Many of these IDPs were hosted in areas reeling from past droughts and were affected by acute malnutrition, disease outbreaks, protection risks and other hazards, including floods. In April 2019, in a period of three weeks, nearly 1 million IDPs had to return to their places of origin, according to assessment findings and protection monitoring reports. These sudden movements have dramatically increased humanitarian needs. Returnees faced poor shelter conditions and lack access to basic services. Moreover, the lean season lasting from June to September -- during which household food security levels typically decline because of reduced production, food security and malnutrition -- was projected to further increase needs, particularly among host communities who had a diminished capacity to host displaced people and share their limited resources.

"Eritrea experiences recurrent drought and variable weather conditions, which are some of the major underlying causes of vulnerability for 70 to 80 per cent of the population. Recurrent droughts contribute to food and nutrition insecurity for women, children, the elderly and for poor rural farming communities. While agricultural production in 2018 was above average due to good rainfall in some locations, pastoral and coastal areas received poor rainfall, causing concern for the food security and livelihoods of vulnerable drought-affected groups in these areas. In addition, malnutrition remains a key concern in Eritrea, with four of the six zobaszobas reporting Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rates well above WHO emergency thresholds (2016/17). While there is no Humanitarian Response Plan in Eritrea, the UNCT has an internal Basic Services Response Priorities (BSRP) document for 2019.

The UN's World Health Organization assessed four priority countries at major risk of being affected by the spread of the disease beyond the national borders of the DRC. Burundi, Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda are at high risk because of their proximity to the outbreak affected areas and the large-scale movement of goods and people across their border with DRC. The Government of Burundi, with its technical and financial partners, has put in place an Ebola Contingency Plan (ECP) to be prepared for the eventual spread of the disease from DRC.

"Djibouti experienced heavy rains on 21-28 November 2019, triggering flash floods and causing the destruction of infrastructure, homes and livelihoods across the country. While Djibouti’s yearly average rainfall is 127mm or less, in Djibouti city the equivalent of 2 years of rainfall occurred at the peak 3-day period on 21-23 November, with over 295mm of rainfall recorded. An estimated of 150,000 people, including migrants and refugees, needed immediate humanitarian assistance. Affected areas were the same areas hit by Cyclone Sagar and subsequent flooding in late May 2018, and the vulnerable people that were affected then were still recovering when they were hit by this new flooding. Flooding impacted household food security, with 95 per cent of affected households reporting losing key household food stock in Djibouti city. Further compounding chronic food insecurity was the loss of crops, rearing animals and the expansion of the desert locust invasion, triggered by the heavy rains. Given the concerning sanitation situation, coupled with limited access to safe water, and with forecast more rains, the risk of potential outbreak is rising.

"In 2018 and 2019, the deteriorating food insecurity, political instability and conflict has increased the flow of refugees and asylum seekers from the Horn and Eastern Africa to Djibouti. Djibouti hosts over 28,000 refugees and asylum seekers, mainly from Somalia and Ethiopia, and from Eritrea and Yemen. Refugee flows from Yemen continued to increase. The humanitarian situation was further compounded by recurrent droughts which have had a critical impact on food security and livelihoods, and adversely affected access to safe water sources for the most vulnerable populations, including those living in rural areas as well as migrants and refugees. The increased influx of migrants has exacerbated the already poor access to water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructures for the populations living within the migrant corridors, and in some areas of Djibouti City. Nutrition was deteriorating amongst the most vulnerable food insecure populations, including migrant and refugee households. Drought conditions made access to safe water sources scarce, especially amongst vulnerable host communities, migrant and refugee populations, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks. Refugees and migrant populations came to Djibouti in poor humanitarian conditions, travelling from areas with the prevalence of cholera, measles, and other diseases, heightening the risk of outbreaks of communicable diseases.

"After an improvement in the humanitarian situation in Burundi between 2018 and 2019, needs increased in 2020 as a result of heavy floods, COVID-19 and an influx of returning Burundians from neighbouring countries following a renewed commitment to the repatriation of Burundian refugees. Consequently, the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan had to be revised to account for an increase of people targeted from 633,000 to 887,000 (a 40 per cent increase). Following the floods, more than 30,000 people were living in IDP sites lacking most basic provisions and amenities. Food, access to water and sanitation, shelter and protection were priorities. The repatriation commitments between Tanzania, Burundi and UNHCR foresaw 2,000 persons returning per week, made all the more difficult under COVID conditions. The primary need was to strengthen the reception framework for such a large number of people by redeveloping transit sites, establishing a three-month assistance package and putting in place preventive barrier measures against COVID-19. Finally, Burundi, like many countries of the region, had a high prevalence of GBV; in the Gatumba area (where severe flooding took place) 475 GBV survivors were registered in June and July 2020 alone.

Assistance to disaster victims in Gatumba and elsewhere in the country, support for the repatriation of Burundian refugees, the activation of national solidarity to fight COVID-19 are among others the priorities of the new Government.

At this key moment, the CERF allocation will be used to strengthen and energize the partnership between the humanitarian community and the government around jointly recognized emergencies. Activities will be aligned with those prioritized by the government, focusing on people affected by natural disasters, returnees from countries neighboring Burundi and the protection of women and girls against acts of gender-based violence.

The priority identified by the United Nations team in the country is to concentrate assistance in favor of the displaced persons who are in the IDP sites, both in the Gatumba area and in makeshift sites in the city and in the provinces, making basic social services accessible: emergency food aid, shelter, water, healthcare and protection services. The changes in the context that encourage refugees to return to their country in the context of COVID-19 constitutes the second priority area. The issue of preventing and combating gender-based violence was considered cross-cutting.

The strategic use of this allocation will find support from government actors who share the choice of areas of concern. In addition, other donors will increase contributions, albeit still minimal, in the same areas and geographic areas. This allocation will further prove the relevance of investing in these areas. Finally, the activities offered under this allowance integrate and strengthen the assistance package that was offered to disaster victims and vulnerable people."

These outbreaks exhibited unusual migratory patterns, mostly affecting remote districts with abnormally high attack rates and case fatality rates. Populations in these hard-to-reach locations were already vulnerable due to weak local public health capacities, low healthcare workers’ ratios, inadequate healthcare services, lack of clean water, poor hygiene and sanitation practices, inaccessibility, and insecurity.

"Somalia expects to see its severely food insecure population triple to 3.5 million between July and September, up from 1.15 million at the start of 2020, due to the cumulative impacts of desert locust infestations, flooding, and COVID-19. This represents 22 per cent of the total Somali population, thereby exceeding the threshold established for the activation of the Anticipatory Action Framework that was designed in 2019. Intensified rainfall during the current Gu season caused severe riverine and flash flooding in April and May across many parts of Somalia and affected an estimated 1 million people, including 412,000 displaced people. The floods inundated and affected crops on close to 50,000 hectares of farmland in southern-central Somalia, which represents one sixth of the total land cultivated across Somalia each season. Gu rains also produced conducive conditions for additional desert locust reproduction, with the ongoing upsurge in Somalia estimated to be the worst in at least 25 years. The flooding has also led to contamination of water sources in 23 districts in the country. According to WHO’s epidemiological data for 2020, there have been 4,834 acute watery diarrhea cases, the majority in Banadir region but also in Hiran, Middle and Lower Shabelle and Bay regions. The situation can quickly escalate due to movement restrictions and a lack of basic goods and services. COVID-19 is further disrupting many aspects of life and trade that underpin food security in Somalia, including food prices, remittances and livestock trade. In line with global trends, the price of imported foods is likely to increase by 20 to 30 per cent, while local food prices have already risen. Purchasing power will decline as COVID-19 causes a reduction in incomes, which is in addition to income and production losses during the Gu season. Remittance flows are expected to fall 30 to 50 per cent through September and a similar decline is expected for livestock exports between June and August due to the cancellation of Hajj activities in Saudi Arabia. As of 24 June 2020, 2,878 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed with 90 deaths further straining the country's fragile health care system.

The Humanitarian Country Team seeks to use the CERF allocation to boost the first phase of the ongoing response and represent among the first of the timely contributions together with a complementary allocation by the Somalia Humanitarian Fund. The scale-up of the flood response will be included in a revision of the Somalia Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) and will be articulated in a flood response plan that is under development. Despite the compounding threats facing Somalia, the revised HRP is only 16 per cent funded (US$200 million out of $1,1254.3 million), as of 11 May."
"Since October 2019, humanitarian conditions significantly deteriorated in Cabo Delgado province due to insecurity and floods. These events progressively led to displacements of people, the disruption of livelihoods and restricted access to basic services. Over 260 attacks by armed groups involving killings, abductions and kidnappings of civilians including girls and women, forced recruitment of children into armed groups as well as burning and looting of public and private properties and infrastructures, rapidly compounded the overall humanitarian situation. Some estimates indicate that some 700 civilians had been killed. In total, 400,000 people were affected (100,000 internally displaced people; 300,000 people in host communities; 14,970 people affected by rains and floods) requiring multi-sectoral urgent life-saving humanitarian assistance and targeted protection services. Moreover, since January 2020, many cases of diarrhoea had also been reported in the province, especially affecting the districts of Ibo, Macomia and Mocimboa da Praia. According to tests recently undertaken by provincial authorities, an outbreak of cholera had been confirmed, involving about 508 cases and causing 12 deaths.

"During the 2019–2020 rainy season, southern Madagascar faced a rainfall deficit which entailed the failure of the crop and livestock production. Food security and malnutrition deteriorated and 554,000 people (24% of the population in the region) were in crisis situation (IPC3 and above). With the additional impact of COVID-19 restrictions, this situation was expected to (and in fact did) deteriorate as the lean season is approaching (January-March 2021). Some 120,000 children under five will be affected by acute malnutrition. According to the latest FEWSNET analysis from June 2020, the number of people in food insecurity will further increase between October and January, with part of the population at risk of emergency levels of food insecurity (IPC4). Water scarcity entailed an increase of the water prices along with an increase of diarrhea cases (+24% between 2018 and 2020) while the health system remains weak in the region. The disruption of the market due to the COVID-19 control measure also led to price increases for staple foods which affects the purchasing power of the most vulnerable people. In addition, food insecurity and COVID-19 paved the way for an increase in gender-based violence (from 90 cases reported in January 2020 to 1,090 in July 2020).

"Starting in September 2019, Rwanda experienced heavy rains that culminated in April-May 2020, causing floods and landslides in several districts across the country. Rainfall estimates showed that the rains in March – April were approximately 80 per cent higher than normal, resulting in landslides and floods in scattered areas causing heightened damages including loss of life. This affected the livelihoods, agriculture, housing, infrastructure and environment sectors. Until 2 June 2020, COVID-19 movement restriction limited access for humanitarian actors which delayed the assessments and response. This led to the Government requesting support to respond to urgent humanitarian needs. Several assessments described the humanitarian needs: A report issued by MINEMA in May 2020 found that all 30 districts in Rwanda were affected by the heavy rains resulting in 317 deaths. Shelter and agriculture were reported as particularly impacted; more than 8,143 houses were partially damaged and destroyed, and 9,383 hectares of crops were lost. A significant number of houses were at risk of damage, owing to structural damages. Many households were coping by reducing the number of meals per day or reduce the quantity of food. A rapid assessment conducted in early June 2020 by the One UN in coordination with MINEMA identified the three hardest hit districts to be Nyabihu, Ngororero and Gakenke. The report showed that 4,716 of the houses damaged were from these Districts and over 20,750 people, including children have been left homeless and approximately 2,602 hectares of agricultural land planted with various crops destroyed. Based on the existing food insecurity and poverty rates and added losses in the form of shelter and loss of livelihoods the number of food insecure people in the three districts is estimated to be 121,495 people. Living conditions for both displaced families and host families had worsened, as well as the risk of malnutrition and increased negative coping mechanisms for families to meet basic food requirements. The increase of infectious diseases such as malaria, influenza and diarrheal diseases were observed among displaced people, exacerbated by overcrowded and poor hygiene living conditions.

"Starting in 2018, Zimbabwe was hit by a severe drought which led to the failure of the 2019 cereals harvest. This situation was compounded by Cyclone Idai (March 2019) and a continued deterioration of the economic situation. Nine districts were classified in IPC4 (one million people in food emergency) with the rest of the country classified in IPC3 (5 million people in food crisis situation). Moreover, the rampant inflation (+540 per cent year-on-year recorded in February 2020) continued to erode purchasing power, especially the most vulnerable urban populations who rely on markets to access to food. In April 2020, the country team launched a Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP), as 7.7 million people needed humanitarian food assistance in rural and urban areas of Zimbabwe, and 2.2 million people in urban areas had no secure access to cereal, the main staple food in Zimbabwe.

Development agencies and the Government have scaled up assistance programmes across the country, with an estimated 3.9 million being assisted in rural areas. In urban areas, 2.2 million people are food insecure. At present, WFP is providing one of the main large-scale cash-based programmes in response to the urban crisis, reaching over 100,000 people, and focusing on food security and resilience-building. However, given the scale of need, much further support is required. In addition, the threat of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Zimbabwe exacerbates the vulnerability of urban households (e.g., overcrowding, lack of access to clean water and sanitation, etc.). On 2 April 2020, the 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan for Zimbabwe was launched, targeting 5.6 million people with food assistance and support in the areas of health, water, sanitation and hygiene, education, protection, nutrition, shelter, and camp coordination and management. The plan requests for a total of $715 million from the international community. In response, the Emergency Relief Coordinator on 6 April allocated $20 million from CERF’s rapid response window for life-saving humanitarian action.

"In mid-March 2019, Zimbabwe was hit by Cyclone Idai and by August the situation had deteriorated because of the failure of the 2019 maize crop. From early 2019, the UN and humanitarian partners had been supporting the Government in responding to a complex set of humanitarian challenges in Zimbabwe. However, by August 2019 the situation had deteriorated significantly as the impact of drought and crop failure compounded by macro-economic challenges, including an extraordinarily high inflation rate, and austerity measures meant that 6.7 million Zimbabweans were in need of humanitarian assistance both in rural districts and urban centres. The food security sector identified 4.1 million people in rural areas who were expected to be severely food insecure at the peak of the lean season in January to April 2020. Of this population, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis pointed to 1.1 million people in emergency (IPC phase 4) and 2.9 million people in crisis (IPC phase 3). Health, education, water, sanitation and hygiene services were significantly reduced. Availability of essential drugs was diminishing. Doctors were on strike as their monthly salary had been reduced due to the hyper-inflation.

"Uganda faced significant humanitarian needs because of displacement and the Covid-19 crisis. It registered its first case on 21 March 2020. By August 2020, Uganda had registered 1,313 cases, including 58 refugees and 55 children, and nine deaths. Hotspots included border communities and Kampala. The pandemic had far-reaching socioeconomic impacts and disproportionally impacted vulnerable groups, exacerbated already high levels of gender-based violence (GBV).  GBV cases increased during the lockdown period: GBV Shelters experienced a 60.5 percent increase (March to June). In refugee communities, the reported cases of GBV increased by 55 percent. The pandemic occurred against the backdrop of one of the world’s largest refugee responses – Uganda hosts 1.4 million refugees, the largest number in Africa (82 percent women and children) – and emerging humanitarian emergencies, including devastating floods and landslides (affecting 55 districts, 470,825 people, displacing 66,860) as well as new swarms of desert locusts (threatening the food security of 1.32 million people). The delivery of essential and lifesaving services, including essential GBV and sexual and reproductive health services, and social protection were disrupted, resulting in long-term impacts and loss of life for affected communities.  Many protections, legal aid and psychosocial support service providers were restricted to remote services, limiting access by the most vulnerable and worsening already low levels of reporting and help-seeking behaviour. There was a decline in the us of antenatal care and facility deliveries in refugee-hosting districts since the onset of COVID-19, as well as among adolescents nationally. By June 2020, 54 percent of refugees in settlements and 26 percent of host communities had inadequate food consumption, with relatively worse consumption in female-headed households. Stunting was reported (up to 32.6 percent) in six refugee settlements. Economic loss and hunger exacerbate existing protection risks, leading to child labour, GBV, transactional sex and trafficking and child marriage. COVID-19 also negatively impacted food security and livelihoods – especially for women and youths, who make up 86 percent of the informal sector, urban slum residents, and refugees.",Report Available,773,2020,20-UF-UGA-45310,83,Uganda,UGA,2,Underfunded Emergencies,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,Uganda UF Application Oct 2020 (Displacement),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,264082,UN Women;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WHO,4999336.0000,2020-11-10,2020-11-19,"The CERF allocation aims to ensure that CERF interventions support Government priorities focusing on a historically underfunded area (GBV) which has been dramatically exacerbated by the current COVID-19 context. In doing so, the allocation sends an important message to other donors on the strategic importance of funding this priority.The strategy is also well coordinated and complementary to donor funding to other key sectors, such as food security. To ensure maximum impact, the allocation has been strategically focused on refugee settlements where the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly exacerbated pre-existing humanitarian vulnerability, and Kampala as an urban COVID-19 “hot spot”. In these target locations, CERF interventions will address priority needs, which in addition to GBV response include general protection assistance, sexual and reproductive health services, COVID-19/health responses and life-saving nutrition interventions for malnourished mothers and young children. 

2)	ERC’s Four Underfunded Priority Areas

Gender. The UN Country Team (UNCT) has identified prevention and response to GBV; access to health including sexual and reproductive health services; and nutrition interventions for malnourished mothers and young children as priority areas to be addressed by this CERF allocation. The UFE submission will focus on a multi-sectoral response to the rise in GBV, historically triggered by displacement, and exacerbated this year by COVID-19, both in refugee settlements and in urban “hot spot” areas. 
People with Disabilities. CERF interventions will also directly benefit an estimated 36,000 persons living with disabilities in eight districts. 
Protection. Uganda hosts 1.4 million refugees (82% are women and children), the largest caseload in Africa, and CERF funds will support protection interventions in these underfunded refugee settings. 
Education. Education is not addressed through this allocation. 
Projects prioritized for the CERF submission will be discussed and reviewed by the UNCT before submission to the CERF Secretariat to ensure they adequately mainstream the ERC’s priority areas.

3)	Funding envelope for GBV
Whilst $500,000 was earmarked for GBV response, the UNCT has made GBV the cornerstone of this entire allocation. CERF funds will be used to scale up GBV interventions in hotspot districts and addressing existing gaps. GBV-focused activities include specific protection interventions including legal aid, with special emphasis on working with women and youth-led organizations, and cultural and religious leaders. CERF funding will also enable agencies to scale-up GBV prevention and response to refugees – including time-critical individual case management and child protection case management for children at risk. UNHCR will catalyze a stronger legal assistance approach, offering legal aid clinics and Mobile Courts in refugee settlements to bring services closer to communities and improve access to justice; and will strengthen referral systems to ensure women and girls who experience physical and sexual violence gain access to quality multi-sectoral life-saving services. WHO will support surveillance and COVID testing for better management of GBV; and UNICEF will provide life-saving nutrition services to the most vulnerable families in refugee hosting districts and in Kampala. Local organizations working on GBV have been prioritized through partnerships with UNWOMEN and UNICEF, who have strong historical networks in these areas.

4)	Funding Requirements and Complementarity
The responses to the refugee crisis and to COVID-19 in Uganda are both critically under-funded. UNHCR estimates that it has received around 22% of its requirements for the refugee response, while FTS reports that the COVID-19 Emergency Appeal (which includes GBV) has received just 3% of the funding required. The UN Country Team launched an Emergency Appeal on COVID-19, with the aim of mobilizing US$316m to support 12.8 million people (approx. 52% women and girls). Uganda has obtained a commitment of US$2 million from the Norwegian Royal Embassy for the Multi-Partner Trust Fund, while $30 million has been mobilized outside the MPTF, leaving a considerable funding gap. The UN Uganda Multi-Partner Trust Fund/Emergency Window has been established, with an initial pledge of US US$2 million from Norway. In July 2020, Uganda was included in the Global Humanitarian Response Plan, and a portfolio of interventions addressing most urgent needs was developed. CERF UFE funding will enable the UNCT to enhance coherence and leverage partnerships, and the strategy addresses humanitarian needs in a development context, closely coordinated and in coherence with government, who are proponent of ‘delivering as one’ and a champion of both the nexus and the SDGs, and with civil society. There is strong funding complementarity with other donors such as Japan who will fund WFP (not included in the CERF allocation). The strategy is aligned with the UNDP CCA, the COVID Appeal and its related socio-economic impacts, and the Cooperation Agreement with the Government.

5)	Operational Prioritization of CERF Funds
The allocation focuses on providing women and girls with access to GBV prevention and response mechanisms through integrated and survivor-centred life-saving service delivery, reducing GBV risks by supporting access to protection, time-critical life-saving and multi-purpose cash transfers for access to basic needs, and livelihoods for survivors of GBV. The allocation is targeted at preventing maternal and child mortality through the provision of timely and quality sexual, reproductive, maternal, new-born, health services within selected districts, and addressing the nutritional needs for vulnerable groups. These groups include GBV survivors and women at risk, urban communities, households with high rates of malnutrition, and people living with disabilities, including in refugee settlements. The CERF allocation will be implemented in eight districts of Uganda: Kampala and surrounding urban areas as well as in seven refugee settlements in Bidibidi, Adjumani, Palorinya, Palabek; Kyangwali, Rwamwanja and Kyaka II, targeting 400,000 people. The target population will include the elderly, people living with disabilities, women and girls, refugees, widows, female-headed households, market women, street vendors, people living with HIV and TB, and migrants."
"The exceptionally abundant rainfalls during the October-December 2019 period, along with Cyclone Pawan, provided favorable conditions for the breeding of desert locusts in Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and other countries in eastern Africa. In early January 2020, desert locust swarms were present across more than 2,350 km2 in Ethiopia, 2,400 km2 in Kenya and 700 km2 in Somalia.

The impact of the floods worsened the humanitarian situation which was already constrained by conflict, displacement, food insecurity and communicable disease outbreaks. Although the humanitarian community responded immediately at the onset of the crisis using existing resources, especially in the most affected states of Jonglei, Lakes and Unity, the number of people affected by flooding and in need of immediate humanitarian assistance was alarmingly high. The impact of the floods was overwhelming as the humanitarian community struggled with its rapidly dwindling resources in its effort to keep people safe in dry homes, avoiding more displacements.

"In 2020, people in South Sudan were faced with multiple shocks, local and sub-national violence, flooding, inflation and increased food prices. An estimated 7.5 million people, including 1.6 million IDPs, were projected to require humanitarian assistance (HNO 2020) at the beginning of the year. The widespread flooding witnessed in 2020 further affected more than 870,000 people, causing massive displacements, destruction of crops, disruption of trade routes and increasing the risk of water borne diseases.

"Since 2018 southern Angola had experienced severe drought, which led to rising hunger and acute malnutrition, and left at least 1.5 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance. The most affected provinces were Cuando Cubango, Cunene, Huila, Namibe, Bie, Cuanza Sul and Benguela. Some 562,000 people out of a population of 904,000 in the 23 locations were assessed to be in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. Assessments indicated that they would face difficulties in accessing food or would only be able to meet minimum food needs through emergency lifesaving interventions in 2020. It was projected that food security in 14 out of 23 areas would be in food security Emergency (IPC phase 4) in the period October 2019 to February 2020. The increased impact of the drought from October 2019 to February 2020 led to a new nutrition emergency in southern Angola, with increasing numbers of children presenting symptoms of severe acute malnutrition (SAM). A nutrition (SMART) survey conducted in early December 2019 in the ten most affected municipalities of Huila and Cunene suggested a serious nutrition situation. The prevalence of global acute malnutrition (GAM) in Huila was 10.8 per cent and the SAM rate was 2.1 per cent. In Cunene, GAM was 10.6 per cent and SAM 1.1 per cent. Access to safe drinking water and sanitation services was already low prior to the drought and decreased further, heightening the risk of communicable diseases. In Huila, 35.5 per cent of the population had access to safe drinking water, while in Cunene only 23 per cent of the population had access to safe water and only 12 per cent of households had access to toilets. Access to education was also affected, as many of the predominantly pastoralist families took their sons out of school in response to the need to travel longer distances in search for pasture and water.

"Infestations of African Migratory Locusts (AML) started in February 2020 and then affected huge areas of Botswana (97,598 hectares affected and 4,201ha controlled), Namibia (500,000ha affected and 120,000ha controlled), Zambia (472,540ha affected and 100,900ha controlled) and Zimbabwe (39,712ha affected and 76ha controlled). Swarms also appeared in Angola. Despite sustained control campaigns by the five concerned countries, the AML infestation continued to spread from initial areas and became a critical threat to the food and nutrition security and livelihoods of vulnerable communities and households. In addition, Red Locust infestations also appeared creating an additional risk of crop and grazing failure in the region. Irrigated crops and grazing were devastated in some areas and locusts were posing a grave threat to the main planting season that was to commence in November 2020.  In September 2020, a $18.9 million Regional Locust Response Plan (RLRP) was developed by FAO, SADC, IRLSCOCSA and other key stakeholders, and launched by SADC. It included a $3.9 million emergency locust control component and a $15 million component for food security and the restoration of livelihoods. This Regional Response Plan was in turn anchored into respective National Locust Response Plans that had been developed by the respective humanitarian community (UNCT/RCO, NGOs and the government response team). Only 13% of the emergency funding requirements of $3.9 million were available through FAO’s emergency internal resources ($500,000).",Report Available,778,2020,20-RR-SOA-45759,270,Southern Africa,SOA,3,Rapid Response,13,Insect infestation,Natural Disaster,Southern Africa RR Application Nov 2020 (Locust),3,Biological (human disease outbreak and other health emergency),1,Natural Disaster,4,Southern Africa,5,Southern Africa,1,Africa,2312700,FAO,2000000.0000,2020-11-23,2020-11-23,"Since mid-2020, parts of southern Africa have been facing serious infestations of African Migratory Locusts. Affected countries include Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The locust infestations come amidst severe food and nutrition insecurity among affected communities as a result of the poor performance of the 2019/20 harvest. In Namibia, 170,000 people are already in food crisis (IPC phase 3 and above), 750,000 in Zambia, and 1.4 million in Zimbabwe. Devastation of crops and livestock grazing due to locust outbreaks could further exacerbate the already fragile food and nutrition situation and greatly increase humanitarian needs among affected people. It is particularly important to control the locust swarms before the forthcoming main planting season starting in November 2020, in order to avoid its spread and additional devastating damage on crops and grazing.

In September 2020, the Regional Locust Response Plan, developed by FAO, SADC, IRLSCOCSA and other key stakeholders, was launched to guide the response. The Plan  appeals for $18.4 million including $3.4 million for locust control and monitoring, and $15 million for livelihoods recovery.
   
In response, on 29 October 2020, the Emergency Relief Coordinator allocated $2 million from CERF’s rapid response window for locust control and monitoring in the five affected countries to be implemented by FAO. The main activities focus on procurement of pesticide and logistics support for ground and aerial pesticide spraying along with swarms monitoring."

"In 2019, Mauritania was hit by a drought which led to a decrease in agriculture production by 13 per cent compared to the ten-year average. The most drought affected regions were Hodh El Chargui, Guidimakha, Assaba and Tagant. Livestock was also affected due to the lack of pasture and water for animals. Consequently, the agropastoralist and pastoralist livelihoods are dramatically eroding, leading to a significant increase in food and nutrition insecurity. The Cadre Harmonise indicated that 609,180 people will be severely food insecure (IPC 3 and above) untill June 2020.

"The northern Central America dry corridor, including Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, has been strongly impacted by droughts and extended dry spells since 2015, due to the strong influence of the El Niño phenomena. This has resulted in loss of vital harvests (mainly maize and beans) and death of livestock and domestic animals among poor and vulnerable farmers. The Emergency Food Security Assessment (EFSA) carried out by the WFP in November 2019 estimated that around 2.3 million people, including 450,000 children under 5, suffer from moderate and severe food insecurity, mostly in 13 out of the 22 states.  The prevalence of chronic malnutrition in children under 5 at national scale is 49 per cent. In rural areas, malnutrition rates increase to 60 per cent. Chronic malnutrition is also reported in a high percentage of pregnant and lactating women. The national rate of maternal mortality in Guatemala is 108 deaths per every 100,000 inhabitants. This figure, in the target state of Huehuetenango, climbs up to 201, one of the highest in the Latin America region.

"In 2020, 4.6 million people will need humanitarian assistance, corresponding to one in three Haitians. The latest IPC analysis indicates that as many as 4.1 million people (40% of the population) are at risk of food insecurity as of March 2020, including 1.2 million (12% of the population) in emergency phase and 2.8 million people (28% of the population in crisis phase). Increasing prices for basic foods, the depreciation of the Gourde (Haitian currency), socio-political unrest and deteriorating security conditions have greatly reduced access to food for the poorest households. In rural areas, the 2018 drought, which extended into the first half of 2019, caused agricultural production in some parts of the country to drop by about 12% compared to the year prior. Malnutrition also increased in 2019. Between January and August, nutritional screening data indicated global acute malnutrition rates of up to 10% in some regions. 



The unrest that hit Haiti in 2019 severely affected the capacity of already very fragile health facilities and provision of services. Latest estimates from the Ministry of Education indicated that at least 3 million children across the country did not have access to school in the first quarter of the current school year. In addition, more than 60% of schools were closed, 57% of schools do not have access to any drinking water, and 45% do not have toilets. The combination of food insecurity, reduced livelihoods, lack of access to school and the general increase in the vulnerability of families, generate high risks, including physical violence, trafficking and/or sexual exploitation for children and young people.



According to a survey conducted in December 2019, 45% of respondents considered the highest risk for children and adolescents outside of school was gang recruitment. The almost permanent insecurity creates an environment conducive to an increase in protection incidents. The main concern remains poor access to basic services for survivors of abuse, and a weak capacity for effective response by service providers. In addition, almost a third (29%) of women have experienced physical or sexual violence. Responses to medical and psychological needs as well as legal support and social protection are insufficient and become almost non-existent in the event of a crisis. In 2019, gender-based violence prevention and response systems and services were repeatedly interrupted, particularly putting women and girls at risk of human rights violations, physical and sexual violence and abuse.

"The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the most vulnerable populations in Colombia, aggravating pre-existing conditions including the impact of internal conflict dynamics, disasters, and large migration movements. With the expansion of the pandemic, the number of people in need of humanitarian assistance surged from five million at the end of 2019 to 7.7 million by 2022. The departments of Chocó and Nariño were among the most affected by the armed conflict in the country, leading to mass displacements and forced confinement with a severe impact on rural, mostly indigenous population and in particular on women and children. During 2021, 85 per cent of all people living in confinement (55,638 people) came out of these two departments, despite only accommodating 4 per cent of Colombia’s population. Similarly, 35,347 of the 73,974 people affected by forced mass displacements came out of Chocó and Nariño, illustrating the fact that the armed groups leverage the pandemic to increase their territorial and social control over the population, particularly in the prioritized departments. Following the finalization of the CERF-funded projects, the department of Chocó, among others, continues to be heavily affected by the armed conflict. Over 42,000 people from 94 indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities are in confinement due to the territorial expansion of the country’s largest paramilitary group, called AGC, and the territorial recovery strategy of the ELN – the country’s largest guerrilla group. Furthermore, both departments are heavily impacted by the pandemic with high infection rates. The poverty rate in Chocó (61.1%) is among the highest in Colombia, as is the level of food insecurity at household level (76.8%). In addition, Chocó and Nariño are the departments with the highest maternal and perinatal mortality rates in the country.

"Over the last 25 years, storms and floods have resulted in around 15,000 deaths and affected 150 million people in Bangladesh. Approximately 80% of Bangladesh’s yearly rainfall occurs during the main monsoon season between June and October. The 2019 floods affected over 7.6 million people, and damaged nearly 550,000 homes. Floods usually occur March to September with peaks between June and September, although research shows that the monsoon season is moving earlier due to climate change. In some years monsoon flooding in Bangladesh is intense and surpasses the ability of communities to cope, leading to deaths and the destruction of key infrastructure, livelihoods and homes.

In response, the Emergency Relief Coordinator on 11 April allocated $2.5 million from CERF's rapid response window to support life-saving humanitarian relief in Vanuatu. The key strategic objectives of the CERF allocation are a reflection of the critical life-saving assistance urgently required, and include four objectives: (1) Provision of immediate life-saving and life-sustaining safe drinking water, food assistance, nutrition support and health care to the people most affected by Tropical Cyclone Harold, (2) provision of emergency shelter, cash and non-food items for people whose houses have been partially or fully damaged, (3) support for local and international logistics to support effective and timely distribution, (4) provision of adequate protection to people in need."
"The COVID-19 pandemic was an unprecedented public health emergency affecting all countries worldwide. While the scope of the pandemic differed between countries, the disease rapidly propagated in the vast majority of them, affecting an increasing number of people. Data and analysis conducted following the release of the Global Humanitarian Response Plan in late March 2020 confirmed the anticipated humanitarian impact of the pandemic on the health and socioeconomic conditions of vulnerable groups. Concerns grew around the disruption of essential health services as lockdown measures and fear of infection led to significant reductions in utilization and access. Due to disruption of air flights, vaccines shipments to countries fell by approximately 80 per cent, and an increasing number of countries reported depleting stocks, impairing essential vaccination campaigns. Particularly vulnerable groups included older persons, people with comorbidities, people with mental health and psychosocial needs, persons with disabilities, women, children and youth, forcibly displaced persons, refugees, asylum seekers and migrants, and people who have lost their sources of income and fall outside social protection systems.

It has a foothold across the globe and is now reaching countries that were already facing humanitarian crisis because of conflict, natural disasters and climate change. To kick-start the response plan, the ERC released an additional $60 million from CERF's Rapid Response Window. This brings CERF’s support to humanitarian action in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to $75 million. This new CERF allocation – one of the largest ever made – will support: WFP to ensure the continuity of supply chains and transport of aid workers and relief goods; WHO to contain the spread of the pandemic; and other agencies to provide humanitarian assistance and protection to those most affected by the pandemic, including women and girls, refugees and internally displaced people.

"On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to a cluster of pneumonia patients in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. One week later Chinese authorities confirmed that they had identified a novel (new) coronavirus as the cause of the pneumonia: COVID-19. The following weeks saw an exponential growth in number of cases and deaths, first in China and then worldwide, with ongoing community transmission and rapid international spread. The number of cases rose from 11,953 on 1 February to 88,948 as of 2 March, with 3,043 deaths in 72 countries. Since the first cases were reported, WHO, UNICEF and partner agencies have been working with Chinese authorities and global experts to learn more about the virus, including how it is transmitted, the populations most at risk, the spectrum of clinical disease, and the most effective ways to detect, interrupt, and contain human-to-human transmission and mitigate the impact of the outbreak, including the social impacts inherent to the outbreak response.

"In the occupied Palestinian territory, 2.4 million Palestinians – around half the population – were in need of protection and humanitarian assistance in 2020. This as the result of the denial of or restrictions to access to essential services, such as water and health care, as well as the freedom movement of people and goods. As a result, the resilience of vulnerable households have been eroded by recurrent shocks and poverty and unemployment are at extremely high levels, especially in Gaza, leading to high levels of food insecurity among vulnerable Palestinians. The overall figure of 2.4 million people in need includes 1.1 million targeted Palestine refugees across the oPt, for whom UNRWA is uniquely mandated  to carry out direct relief activities. In the West Bank, Palestine refugees continued to experience protection concerns and difficult socio-economic conditions due to the Israeli military occupation. In 2020, the situation was further compounded by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, which increased the burden on an already overstretched health system. Thanks to the strict quarantine measures imposed by the authorities for persons coming into Gaza from Israel and Egypt, the number of COVID-19 cases remained low during the first half of the year. During 2020, tensions increased following the release of the “Deal of the Century” and the announcement of plans by the Government of Israel to annex parts of the West Bank. Israeli Security Forces (ISF) operations in Palestine refugee camps continued, often involving the use of live ammunition and tear gas, resulting in casualties, property destruction and longer-term psychosocial consequences. Demolition and confiscation of Palestinian home and properties, as well as the continued expansion of Israeli settlements, were also a cause for concern. The difficult socio-economic conditions faced by Palestine refuges in the West Bank were exacerbated by the impact of the lockdowns and movement restrictions imposed to contain the virus. A steady increase in COVID-19 cases was reported in the West Bank in the latter half of the year, further straining the public health system and leading to further deterioration in socio-economic conditions.

"The humanitarian consequences of the crisis in Syria were profound. Among the 21.7 million people in Syria, 14.6 million people needed some form of humanitarian assistance in November 2021. Of these, 4.9 million people were considered to be in acute need. Ten years on from the start of the crisis, 6.9 million people remain internally displaced and 5.6 million people have fled their homes to neighboring countries. In 2019, over 1.5 million people were displaced inside Syria. This number is on a decreasing trend but still significant. From January to August 2021, 346,995 people were displaced internally compared to the 1.3 million IDPs during the same timeframe in 2020. There has been, and continues to be, extensive damage to crucial civilian infrastructure, such as schools, water supply systems, health facilities, and housing. In areas where hostilities have subsided, life remains a daily struggle due to limited access to basic services, increasing financial hardship and eroding coping capacities. An estimated 97 percent of the population now live under the poverty line, with 60 per cent experiencing abject poverty. Recent economic shocks risk setting back the recovery of the Syrian people even further, and rendering many more acutely vulnerable.

"The 4 August 2020 explosion of a warehouse in Beirut Port containing 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate caused widespread damage and loss of life in the immediate vicinity of central Beirut. Over 200 people were killed while others remained missing. More than 6,000 people were injured. This led to shortages of medicines, disposable and dressing materials and equipment required across the healthcare system in Lebanon, which was already fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and facing a crippling socio-economic crisis. The explosion also destroyed a shipment of COVID-19 Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs), and damaged warehouses for medical supplies located in the port. An initial total of 1,144 buildings in the vicinity of the Port were assessed as at risk of collapse with more than 30,600 people having to vacate. More broadly, the blast wave damaged thousands of apartments in other buildings in neighbouring areas, and more widely across Beirut.  Six major hospitals and twenty clinics sustained partial or heavy structural damage and out of 55 medical facilities within a 15-kilometre radius of the explosions, only half were fully operational with around 40 per cent having suffered moderate to serious damage and requiring rehabilitation.

"Lebanon remains at the forefront of one of the worst humanitarian crises of our time and continues to host the highest number of displaced persons per capita in the world. As of March 2021, the Government of Lebanon estimates that the country hosts around 1.5 million Syrians who have fled the conflict in Syria (including 865,531 registered as refugees with UNHCR as of the end of December 2020), along with 27,700 Palestine refugees from Syria and a pre-existing population of an estimated 180,000 Palestine refugees from Lebanon. Syrian refugees are living in every part of the country; 20 per cent live in informal settlements, 2% in collective shelters and the rest reside in private accommodation. As for Palestine refugees, most live in the 12 organized camps, while the remaining reside in 156 gatherings. 

Lebanon has faced a deep economic and financial crisis since late 2019, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the devastating explosions in the Beirut port on 4 August 2020. The protracted nature of the refugee situation with limited self-reliance possibilities, coupled with the impact of these recent crises, have led to an exponential rise in extreme poverty among refugees. The 2020 Vulnerability Assessment of Syrian Refugees found that 89 per cent of Syrian refugee households are now under the extreme poverty line, up from 55 per cent only a year before.

"Unrest in the occupied Palestinian territory had been on the rise since mid-April 2021, initially in East Jerusalem, spreading to other parts of the West Bank and then extending to Gaza. The period between 10 and 21 May witnessed the most serious escalation of hostilities between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups in the Gaza Strip since the 2014 conflict and the humanitarian consequences were devastating. According to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), up to 21 May, 242 Palestinians, including 66 children and 38 women were killed, of whom 129 were believed to be civilians. Almost 2,000 Palestinians were injured during the hostilities, including over 600 children and 400 women. High-intensity bombing caused widespread psycho-social impacts. In Gaza, around 2,000 housing units were totally destroyed or damaged beyond repair, and nearly 15,000 units suffered some degree of damage, resulting in over 36,000 people being displaced with host families. Over 70,000 were displaced in UNRWA schools at the height of hostilities. A total of 54 education facilities, six hospitals and eleven primary health care centres sustained damage across the Strip. Multiple water and sanitation facilities and infrastructure were hit and damaged in more than 100 Israeli strikes. The daily power supply was reduced to only 5-6 hours, down from 15 hours previously.

The violence displaced over 77,000 Palestinians who were seeking protection in 58 UNRWA schools, including in 23 designated emergency shelters (DES). There was concern about the transmission of COVID-19 between vulnerable people who huddled in crowded shelters and the inability of the health-care system to cope. Many people have returned home since.

The hostilities also caused serious damage to vital civilian infrastructure in Gaza affecting water, sanitation and hygiene services for hundreds of thousands of people.

"Lebanon was grappling with economic and financial meltdown, COVID-19, the disastrous impact of the Beirut Port explosions and continued impact of the Syrian crisis. In addition, political deadlock fueled popular protests and hampered meaningful reform and recovery efforts. In this context, the situation of ordinary people in Lebanon was worsening day by day.

Since mid-August 2021, the fuel and electricity shortages were impeding the provision of essential services including, but not limited to, health and water utilities across Lebanon, putting hundreds of thousands of families at risk of a humanitarian catastrophe. 

Public water supply and wastewater treatment systems, which were heavily reliant on fuel, had drastically reduced their operations across the country, leaving millions of people without access to public water while jeopardizing the environmental and public health amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

This CERF allocation, complemented by a parallel LHF allocation supporting health services, facilitated access to fuel for essential water stations across the country and thereby ensuring the provision of public water supply to more than 2/3 of the population. Without imminent support to the Water Establishments more than two third of the population in Lebanon, as well as key health facilities, would have no longer had access to water in their premises.",Report Available,840,2021,21-RR-LBN-48999,52,Lebanon,LBN,3,Rapid Response,35,Economic Disruption,Unspecified Emergency,Lebanon RR Application Sep 2021 (Fuel crisis),5,Conflict-related,0,,14,Western Asia,15,Western Asia,3,Asia,1800000,WFP,3998359.0000,2021-09-10,2021-09-10,"Lebanon is grappling with an economic and financial crisis, COVID-19, the disastrous impact of the Beirut Port explosions and continued impact of the Syrian crisis. In this context, the situation of ordinary people in Lebanon is worsening day by day. As of 20 August 2021, fuel and electricity shortages are impeding the provision of essential services, including healthcare and drinking water, across Lebanon, putting thousands of families at risk of a humanitarian crisis. Many hospitals in Lebanon have already reduced their activities due to fuel shortages and electricity outages. Meanwhile, public water supply and wastewater treatment systems, which are heavily reliant on fuel, have drastically reduced their operations across the country, leaving millions of people without access to public water while jeopardizing the environmental and public health amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.

In response, on 31 August, the Emergency Relief Coordinator allocated $4 million from CERF to achieve one main objective: Provide fuel to keep water stations active and operational across the country and thereby ensure the provision of drinking water to more than two-thirds of the country population. The CERF allocation complements a $6 million allocation from the Lebanon Humanitarian Fund to provide fuel to 65 hospitals in Lebanon, as well as primary health-care centres, dispensaries and medical cold chain storage."
"The COVID-19 situation exacerbated already existing gender inequalities, and brought about a marked increase in incidents of gender-based violence (GBV) affecting primarily women and girls, while putting others at risk. This is the primary trigger for this allocation. Women and girls are already experiencing enhanced vulnerabilities during humanitarian crises – which the COVID-19 situation has brought to the forefront. Increases in GBV incidents, including but not limited to domestic violence, intimate partner violence, physical abuse, forced coexistence, forced and early marriages, are aggravated symptoms of a situation made far worse by the global pandemic. 

Women and girls worldwide, and especially in the countries targeted by the present global allocation, are in acute need of protection engagements and more resilience-oriented measures, in order to save their lives, alleviate their suffering and preserve their dignity. The 11 countries included in this allocation were already experiencing longstanding humanitarian crises of their own, which the global pandemic has further aggravated.

The allocation is protection-focused (and specifically on GBV outcomes, targeting mainly women and girls). The projects target GBV survivors, at risk and vulnerable women and girls, including those with disabilities. Men and boys are engaged to be sensitized about GBV. The activities proposed are based on their unique needs that aim to achieve positive outcomes for women and girls. Agencies in the allocation put protection at the core of their activities and aim to promote women’s safety and dignity, including building their capacity to live with increased safety and dignity throughout their displacement. This allocation considers the risks of resistance and backlash from the community when trying to change gender norms and gender barriers and will therefore carefully monitor the  impact on the community and women beneficiaries to respect the Do No Harm principles and ensure the participants’ safety.",Completed,783,2021,20-RR-GLB-46341,269,Global,GLB,3,Rapid Response,22,Human Rights,Unspecified Emergency,Global RR Application Dec 2020 (GBV programming),5,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,23,Global,24,Global,6,Global,36000000,UN Women;UNFPA,25004109.0000,2021-02-09,2021-02-12,Summary will be available soon.

"At the beginning of February 2021 intense clashes broke out in several districts of Ma’rib and Al Jawf governorates leading to a large-scale displacement and further deterioration of living conditions of already displaced populations. Initial field reports indicated massive displacement within Ma’rib Governorate, especially from Sirwah District, which has seen the heaviest fighting. Ma’rib Governorate already hosts an estimated 800,000 IDPs – the largest IDP population in Yemen according to local authorities – and some 150,000 live in approximately 125 IDP sites. According to the IOM, some people have been displaced on average three times and most newly displaced people had been living in displacement sites, with some reportedly carrying their shelters with them to their new locations. An estimated 60 per cent of new IDPs are reportedly residing in informal settlements/crowded IDP sites with constrained access to basic services. Further reports received in March indicated escalation of hostilities on the Sana’a-Marib-Al Jawf front lines and another large-scale population displacement in Al Hazem and Khab Wa Ash Sh’af districts in Al Jawf Governorate.

The HCT intends to focus on four priorities: (1) Provide shelter to 10,000 households; (2) Ensure safe access to sanitations services at new sites for displaced people and host communities; (3) Strengthen the prevention of, and response to, protection issues including child protection, gender-based violence and managing the risk of improvised explosive devices; and (4) Improve access to basic health care for displaced people and host communities, including sexual and reproductive health. This request is aimed at kick-starting a multi-sectoral response to the Spring Contingency Plan. The strategy is focused on 4 sectors: nutrition, health, WASH and agriculture. In particular agricultural and livelihoods assistance is expected to prevent some displacement due to water scarcity and drought-like conditions. CERF resources will be focused in the high and medium risk areas identified in the Spring Plan. The overall number of people to be reached is 630,000, as per the request."
"At the time this $45 million CERF rapid response allocation was made, humanitarian needs in Afghanistan were enormous and increasing. There were concurrent emergencies due to different types of hazards: a violent conflict, large-scale displacement, a pandemic that continued to spread, and a major drought. At the start of 2021, 18.4 million people needed humanitarian assistance, the fourth largest number globally and a 32 per cent increase from 2020. This increase in humanitarian need was being complicated by a suspension of development funding for the Sehatmandi project. The World bank funded initiative had been the backbone of the Afghan health system, providing support to over 2,331 health facilities across all 34 provinces of the country. Following the suspension of the project, the health cluster in Afghanistan warned that 90 per cent of these facilities would close unless urgent action was taken. The Afghan health system would collapse, and 20 years of progress would be lost. This would have a rippling effect on the availability of basic and essential health care, nutrition services, and the livelihoods of thousands of health care workers including community midwives and nurses. Without funding, services provided through the Sehatmandi project, including both primary (Basic Package of health Services – BPHS) and secondary (Essential Package of Health Services – EPHS) health service packages would no longer be available and service delivery implemented by NGOs in 2,168 health facilities in 31 provinces and 163 government-run facilities in three provinces would effectively stop, exposing the Afghan population to preventable increases in morbidity and mortality.",Report Available,848,2021,21-RR-AFG-49422,8,Afghanistan,AFG,3,Rapid Response,19,Post-conflict Needs,Conflict-related,Afghanistan RR Application Oct 2021 (Health system),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,10,Southern Asia,13,Southern Asia,3,Asia,0,UNICEF;WHO,45000000.0000,2021-10-13,2021-10-13,"The Emergency Relief Coordinator has released US$45 million in life-saving support from the UN’s Central Emergency Response Fund to help prevent Afghanistan’s health-care system from collapse.

"The crisis in northeast Nigeria continues to disrupt the lives and livelihoods of millions of people across Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe States. Violent attacks by non-state armed groups and Nigerian military counter-operations concentrated in Borno State have displaced people, disrupted farming and other livelihoods, and limited functionality of markets and other basic services. Conditions have been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and associated surge in food prices since April 2020. Restrictions on movement and closure of businesses, markets and public gatherings – ordered by the Government to curb transmission of the virus – had unintended negative impacts on people’s livelihoods, particularly those engaged in work within the informal sector.

The Northern states were disproportionately affected, with the eleven states accounting for more than 80 per cent of the total reported cases in the country. Inadequate access to and management of water services, high rates of open defecation, unhygienic sanitary/waste disposal systems and poor hygiene practices greatly contributed to the spread of cholera in these states. There were huge gaps in subnational government and local institutional capacities to control the outbreak, especially in services related to WASH, surveillance, risk communication, distribution of cholera supplies, case management, coordination and monitoring by partners. The situation was also compounded by the limited fiscal space of state governments and low presence of the humanitarian community in the North-west region.

"The situation had deteriorated in the Central African Republic in the aftermath of the second round of legislative elections in mid-March 2021, compounding existing vulnerabilities and the impact of the COVID-19. One in four Central Africans had been forced to flee their homes.

 The HCT intends to focus on five priorities: 1)Nutrition, including the scale-up of nutritional services,2)Health services for acutely malnourished children and at-risk women in highly food-insecure areas,3)Food security support for households with post-harvest loss caused by the drought,4)Access to safe water and sanitation and 5)Protection services targeted at food-insecure and malnourished communities, including PSEA"

"At the time the CERF request was made, around March/April 2021, people in South Sudan were experiencing one of the worst food insecurity emergencies globally. Across the country, more than 7 million people (approx. 65% of the population) were predicted to face food insecurity and 1.9 million women and children were already acutely malnutritioned. Additionally, reports of the previous year’s cereal and vegetable harvest producing only 50% of other years’ outputs provided an additional indication of an alarming food insecurity trend continuing into the future. The levels of food insecurity in many areas, including the Greater Pibor Administrative Area (GPAA), were particularly alarming, with visible malnutrition and morbidity observed during assessment in Pibor Town, Gumuruk, and Lekuangole. At the time the request was made, access to food in many areas was expected to deteriorate, with food sources –wild foods and fishing – expected to become more limited, leaving humanitarian food assistance as the main source of food.

Some 105,000 people are facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity (IPC phase 5) between December 2020 and March 2021 in six counties in the Greater Pibor Administrative Area (Pibor), Jonglei (Akobo), Northern Bahr El Ghazal (Aweil South), and Warrap (Tonj East, Tonj North and Tonj South). The levels of food insecurity in the Greater Pibor Administrative Area (GPAA) are particularly alarming, with visible malnutrition and morbidity observed during the latest assessment in Pibor Town, Gumuruk, and Lekuangole. This has been driven by insufficient caloric intake, atypical consumption of wild foods, and minimal access to clean water.  Access to food in GPAA is expected to further deteriorate in the coming months, with current food sources – wild foods and fishing – expected to become more limited, leaving humanitarian food assistance as the main source of food.  2021 is already considered by many as the most severe period of hunger experienced in living memory.

"In 2021, South Sudan suffered from a third consecutive year of severe flooding. Floods across many regions led to the displacement of thousands (adding to the continued displacement of people following previous flood events), the destruction of homes and critical public infrastructure, as well as a significant reduction of livelihood opportunities, affecting approx. 780,000 people. The shock’s impact was further compounded by an escalation of violence in areas such as Tambura.  According to an Inter-Cluster Coordination Group (ICCG) situation report from 12 November 2021, the worst affected states included Jonglei (278,000 people), Unity (208,000 people), Upper Nile (126,000), Northern Bahr el Ghazal (65,000), Lakes (61,000), Warrap (23,000), Western Bahr el Ghazal (10,000) and Central Equatoria (10,000). Across these areas, thousands of displaced people took refuge on increasingly scarce higher ground within their country, with many sheltering in churches, schools, and public spaces. With many areas cut off from roads and other infrastructure, a large number of affected people suffered from having only limited or no access to adequate basic services and supplies. While humanitarian responders tried to provide adequate assistance with the resources that were available at the time, the historic scale of the emergency soon overstretched available response capacities, particularly in terms of avoiding pipeline breaks",Report Available,856,2021,21-RR-SSD-50353,91,South Sudan,SSD,3,Rapid Response,6,Flood,Natural Disaster,South Sudan RR Application Nov 2021 (floods),3,Biological (human disease outbreak and other health emergency),1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,780000,IOM;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,12909258.0000,2021-12-13,2021-12-13,"809,000 people have been affected by massive flooding in many parts of the country, compounded by an escalation of violence in areas such as Tambura.

"The overall humanitarian situation in South Sudan remained very fragile, in a context characterized by conflict and sub-national violence, political instability, underdevelopment, food insecurity and environmental hazards; all of which, over many years, had affected the resilience and heightened the vulnerability of large swathes of the population across the country. Meanwhile volatile conditions on the ground continued to prompt sizeable population movements made up of new internal displacement and, increasingly, returns of internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees. These movements converged towards locations where access to services and humanitarian assistance remained extremely limited, increasing the risk of tensions with existing local communities. Further compounded by the impact of COVID-19 the humanitarian situation had taken a disproportionate toll on South Sudanese women and girls as a result of existing structural gender inequality and unequal gender power relationships, with rising levels of gender-based violence (GBV) in a country where the phenomenon was already pervasive before the start of the pandemic. At least 2.2 million children, most of whom were girls, were out of school in South Sudan, prior to the pandemic. Protracted conflict had devastated the country's education system, and the recent pandemic left an additional 2.1 million children out of school.

"In December 2020, the Democratic Republic of the Congo witnessed an inflow of refugees fleeing the violence that erupted in the aftermath of the elections in neighbouring Central African Republic (CAR). As of 20 March 2021, UNHCR had biometrically registered some 52,000 refugees. Many of the refugees resided in some of the most underserved areas in the region and had little to no access to services. The new arrivals were settled along the border with CAR in spontaneous sites across 40 remote localities close to the border. This exposed them to security risks, including physical attacks and retaliation in the event of incursions by Non-State Armed Groups from CAR. Other refugees resided with host families many of whom lived in abject poverty and had to share their already scarce resources with the new arrivals. Their areas of residence were also hard to access given the poor road conditions and general lack of access. Some of these new arrivals still carry the scars of traumatic events experienced before and during their flight to the DRC, including physical after effects, as highlighted during the participatory assessments conducted with refugee men, women, and children. Although the newly arrived refugees had mostly part been well received by the host community, the presence of large numbers of refugees in some host sites could be a trigger for conflict, particularly given the fact that in some areas, new arrivals now outnumbered the local population and lacked access to quality shelter and sanitation.

"Somalia is experiencing severe drought conditions after two consecutive failed rainy seasons, especially affecting the southwest of the country. The current rainy season was also forecast to be poor and has so far indeed been below average. The Southern parts of the country that had remained in moderate drought conditions in the previous months are now facing moderate to severe drought due to further depletion of the limited resources in the areas. This has led to serious human suffering and livestock death. The worst drought impacts are in Jubaland, Southwest state, Galmudug (central regions) and parts of Puntland which have suffered from consecutive seasons of poor rainfall. Water resources and pasture conditions have deteriorated in these areas triggering livestock migration and increased competition among pastoralists on the already limited resources. Given the rainfall forecast, the depressed rains are not going to be effective in mitigating the drought conditions. This has led to shortages of food and water, threatened peoples’ livelihoods, and increased the risk of communicable diseases. In the last quarter of 2021, 3.5 million people, 22% of the population, were expected to face food insecurity, and 1.2 million children were likely to be acutely malnourished.

"After experiencing delayed and erratic rainfall distribution in the previous Deyr season (October to December 2020), more than 50 districts in Somalia were suffering from the impact of drought-like conditions. According to a February 2021 assessment by the Somalia Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit (FSNAU), 1.6 million people were facing a crisis or worse levels of food insecurity at that moment, with 1.45 million in IPC Phase 3 and 149,800 people in IPC Phase 4. Between December 2020 and April 2021, over 95,000 Somalis had been displaced as a result of the failed rainy season and forecasts projected that by the end of 2021 at least 3.4 million people could be affected, with 380,000 expected to become displaced, by drought or drought-like conditions. The situation was comparable to 2017 when Somalia also suffered from extremely severe food insecurity following consecutive droughts. The impacts of the failed 2020 Deyr season added layers of complexity to already unprecedented needs: At a time when communities were already struggling to cope with the impact of COVID-19, continued desert locust infestation, armed conflict, and political instability, skyrocketing water prices, increased displacement, and progressively widespread food insecurity, the drought-like conditions were driving communities to adopt negative coping mechanisms. The increasing and multisectoral needs of affected people were contrasted by diminished resources to provide assistance: In its second quarter of 2021, the humanitarian response plan remained severely underfunded at only 9.7 per cent.",Report Available,810,2021,21-RR-SOM-47079,74,Somalia,SOM,3,Rapid Response,8,Drought,Natural Disaster,Somalia RR Application Apr 2021 (Drought),3,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,1184154,IOM;UNFPA;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,7000046.0000,2021-04-23,2021-05-03,"RAPID RESPONSE ALLOCATION: Delayed and erratic rainfall distribution characterized the October to December 2020 Deyr season, resulting in below-average, cumulative rainfall across most of the country. Pre-drought conditions, including widely depleted water reservoirs and shallow wells, loss of livestock, as well as extensive critical loss of pasture, have already been observed during a January 2021 inter-agency Drought Risk Assessment in Puntland, Somaliland, Galmudug and Jubaland: Only 19 per cent of the 1,250 assessed shallow wells contained water and 27 per cent of all assessed reservoirs were completely depleted. Subsequent assessments also identified dire water shortages in Hirshabelle.

"In 2021 the combined impact of consecutive dry seasons, severe water shortage and rising food prices resulted in increased poverty, widespread displacements, and food insecurity, making Somalia the most severely drought affected country in the Horn of Africa. A spike in conflict and insecurity, exacerbated the humanitarian situation forcing hundreds of thousands of people to flee their homes. The poor 2020 Deyr rainy season (October to December) and forecasts of poor or below average April to June (Gu) rains and beyond led food security experts to predict that up to 2.65 million Somalis (21.5 per cent of the population) could face crisis or worse levels of food insecurity, including 400,000 likely to face emergency levels (3.2 per cent) between April and June 2021 – reaching the trigger thresholds for the AA framework.",Report Available,811,2021,21-RR-SOM-47081,74,Somalia,SOM,3,Rapid Response,8,Drought,Natural Disaster,Somalia RR Application Apr 2021 (Anticipatory Action for drought),3,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,1184154,FAO;IOM;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,20001256.0000,2021-04-26,2021-05-03,"ANTICIPATORY ACTION ALLOCATION: Beyond the current emergency, an even worse crisis is looming in the next months: Several climate forecasts predict the coming April-June rainfall season in Somalia to perform poorly as well.

These projected numbers of food insecurity surpass the trigger for the Somalia Anticipatory Action framework and the Emergency Relief Coordinator will therefore allocate up to an additional $20 million for anticipatory action to prevent such a severe deterioration of the situation. The AA allocation will leverage the pre-agreed action plan developed with different agencies to enable collective, timely, and adequate assistance in the face emerging needs. Notably, this is the second allocation for the anticipatory action framework in Somalia, demonstrating the concept is working and can reach scale. The AA allocation will complement the $7 million CERF RR and $13.3 million SHF allocations which seek to provide immediate support to communities already suffering severe water shortages, as a result of the poor October-December season. In addition, the up to $20 million AA allocation will assist those communities whose well-being, especially food security, is further threatened by the forecast poor March-June season. The joint AA and RR allocation show that the different humanitarian streams can work together and be complementary to achieve greater impact."

"The humanitarian crisis in Northern Ethiopia, in its 8th month at the time of the allocation, was deepening. An estimated 5.2 million people across Tigray were now in need of humanitarian assistance, representing more than 90 per cent of the region’s population. More than two million people had been forced to flee their homes. Of these, more than 63,100 people had fled across the border to Sudan, while more than 1.7 million internally displaced people had been registered across 265 sites in Tigray and the neighbouring regions, with the actual number of internally displaced people estimated well over 2 million. Millions of people were severely food insecure and hundreds of thousands were facing famine-like conditions. Levels of food insecurity and malnutrition were at catastrophic levels in some areas. A recent screening of 21,000 children under age 5 found that more than 21 per cent had life-threatening severe acute malnutrition, significantly above the emergency threshold of 15 per cent. Ethiopia had been included as a priority country in the UN Secretary General's High-Level Taskforce (HLTF) on famine prevention.

"In Ethiopia, many southern and southeastern pastoral areas experienced consecutive poor rainy seasons in late 2020 and early 2021, resulting in water shortages, below-average crop production, poor rangeland conditions, and rising cereal prices across affected areas. That contributed to worsening food insecurity in a region already struggling with multiple other shocks (conflict, insecurity, macroeconomic challenges including the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, and desert locusts). Needs were particularly severe in Borena zone of Oromia region where, according to a June 2021 assessment by the regional Disaster Risk Management Office, some 426,000 people were in need of emergency food support, and Dawa zone in Somali region where water shortages resulted in over 330,000 people depending on water trucking. The situation continued to deteriorate even further, with forecasts expecting a third below-average rainy season between October and December 2021 and a fourth consecutive below-average rainy season between March-May 2022.

Looking forward, the situation is expected to deteriorate even further, with all global and regional forecasts agreeing that there is an increased probability of a third below-average rainy season between October-December 2021. Furthermore, current El Niño forecast-based climate analogs indicate elevated chances of a fourth consecutive below-average rainy season between March-May 2022. 

In response to the existing and projected needs, the Emergency Relief Coordinator on 15 November allocated $5 million from CERF’s Rapid Response window for early response and anticipatory action activities. The Ethiopia Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) proposes to prioritize  the agriculture (livestock) and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sectors as the best way to cover the most life-saving needs given both the consequences of the drought being observed and the projected underperformance of the current and upcoming rainy seasons. The HCT intends to focus on two priorities: (i) to increase access to potable water to communities to prevent waterborne diseases and mitigate risk of cholera outbreaks; (ii) to save core breeding animals and protect livelihoods of pastoral communities in Dawa and Borena."
"One year after the conflict started in November 2020, the situation in northern Ethiopia remained precarious and volatile at the time of this allocation, with the continuation of active hostilities in several locations leading to increased humanitarian needs and vulnerabilities due to large-scale displacement, loss of livelihoods and access to markets, food, and basic services. The crisis in Tigray remained at the time a major humanitarian and protection crisis, with an increased risk of full-scale famine, severe malnutrition, and disease outbreaks. An estimated 5.2 million people across Tigray needed humanitarian assistance, more than 90 per cent of the region’s population. More than two million people had been forced to leave their homes, representing the fastest and largest growth in internal displacement globally, with many people being repeatedly displaced since. Millions of people were already severely food insecure as the agricultural planting season had been missed in many parts of Tigray. There were no available food stocks as many people were prevented from planting for eight months, due to insecurity and deliberate efforts to destroy livelihoods. The conflict also started spreading to new areas in Amhara and Afar at the peak of the harvest season, which was expected to lead to further crop losses and severe food insecurity. WFP reported in a statement on 26 November that the number of people in need of humanitarian food assistance across northern Ethiopia at the time had grown to an estimated 9.4 million as a direct result of conflict. Amhara Region had seen the largest increase of people in need with 3.7 million people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance.",Report Available,857,2021,21-RR-ETH-50320,34,Ethiopia,ETH,3,Rapid Response,33,Violence/Clashes,Conflict-related,Ethiopia RR Application Dec 2021 (conflict),1,Geophysical,0,,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,8100000,FAO;IOM;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,20000028.0000,2021-12-29,2021-12-31,"The situation in northern Ethiopia remains difficult due to ongoing fighting, with severe impact on civilians and increasing humanitarian needs in Tigray, Amhara and Afar.

In response, the Emergency Relief Coordinator on 15 February allocated $20 million from CERF’s rapid response window for life-saving humanitarian action."
"Erratic rains in 2020 in the Southern and South-Eastern part of Ethiopia, coupled with the depletion of surface water sources and low groundwater level, led to severe water scarcity across pastoral and agropastoral areas of Somali and Oromia regions. Already in December 2020, some of the drought early warning triggers could be seen through anecdotal observation including poor performance of rain, reduced milk production, crop failure, shortage of quality and quantity of water for both humans and livestock, abnormal livestock migration with overcrowding in water sources, deterioration of livestock body condition, the high price of cereals and imported foods, lower price of livestock and reduced productivity. The initial assessments by humanitarian partners in 2021 indicated an increase in acute malnutrition as well as livestock in poor condition and communicable livestock disease. After the failed rains in 2020, the drought in 2021 was impacting 86 per cent of areas in Somali and 14 per cent of areas in Oromia. Since January 2021, the drought's devastating effects had been reported in 80 woredas (out of 93 woredas) in the Somali Region and 48 woredas in the Oromia Region (out of 335 woredas). According to the IPC projections for the period January-June 2021 (from December 2020), the nutrition situation in southern and southeastern areas were expected to deteriorate due to limited access to food (including milk) and income. Nutrition outcomes were expected to be most severe from February-July 2021, which is the typical Belg lean period. At the time, the FEWSNET update on Ethiopia (March 2021) noted that southern and southeastern pastoral areas were facing a shortage of pasture and water as rainfall was yet to begin. The Somali region and adjacent areas of Oromia region were in IPC phase 3 (crisis) and projected to stay in that same condition until at least September 2021. The combination of these factors were estimated to contribute to food insecurity, which then would increase malnourishment ahead of the coming long drier season. Overall, an estimated 11.9 million people in Oromia and 4.5 million in Somali were suffering crisis levels of food insecurity (IPC Phase 3) at the time of the allocation.",Report Available,815,2021,21-RR-ETH-47847,34,Ethiopia,ETH,3,Rapid Response,8,Drought,Natural Disaster,Ethiopia RR Application May 2021 (Drought),3,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,5800000,UNICEF;WHO,4978858.0000,2021-05-21,2021-06-08,"The Somali and Oromia regions of Ethiopia are experiencing a severe drought because of erratic rains across the southern and southeastern pastoral and agropastoral areas. Resulting in water scarcity is exacerbating humanitarian needs. The two regions are in IPC phase 3 (crisis) and projected to stay so until September 2021. An estimated 5.8 million people are affected by the drought across the two regions, including 261,000 drought-induced IDPs in 186 sites. The drought is impacting 86% of areas in Somali and 14% of areas in Oromia, altogether affecting 128 of 428 woredas. The number of children admitted with severe acute malnutrition in the targeted woredas has increased by 70% in Somali and 7% in Oromia regions than the period before the drought. Furthermore, the reported incidence of gender-based violence, child labor, and child marriages has increased among drought-affected families. The current drought is being compounded by the socioeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, intercommunal conflicts, and the desert locust infestation.
 
In response, the Emergency Relief Coordinator on 6 May allocated $5 million from CERF’s rapid response window for life-saving humanitarian action.
 
The Humanitarian Country Team (HCT) proposes to focus on providing an integrated package of water, sanitation and hygiene, health, and nutrition assistance to people in the most affected communities in Somali and Oromo regions. The HCT intends to focus on three priorities: (1) Ensure safe access to sanitation services ; (2) Improve access to basic health care for displaced people and host communities, including sexual and reproductive health and (3)  improve access nutrition support through  IYCF (infant and young children feeding) and management of children with medical complications of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)."
"On 7 December, updated forecasts indicated that the trigger for activation of the anticipatory action (AA) framework  had been reached. According to the forecasts, the pre-agreed food insecurity thresholds had been met in multiple regions and the pre-agreed drought thresholds for the spring rains had been met for Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region (SNNPR). Additionally, while not fully having been met at the time, the drought thresholds were very close to being met for Afar, Oromia and Somali regions. This led to the two-stage activation of the pilot, with activities with longer lead times and those requiring an earlier implementation immediately activated.  A second set of activities scheduled to take place later was only activated towards the end of February 2021, based on rainfall projections continuing to predict below-average rainfall for several areas in Ethiopia and the food security thresholds continually being met for the same regions as in December (Afar, Oromia, Somali, SNNP) mainly due to the poor performance of the October-December rains and expected below-average rains for March-May 2021. According to FEWS Net, the March to May gu/genna rainfall in southern and southeastern pastoral areas was erratic, with most rainfall only occurring in late April and early May. Rainfall performance for the March to May diraac/sugum season in northern pastoral areas was extremely poor. Drought conditions were present across much of Afar, northern and western areas of the Somali Region, and parts of eastern Oromia at the end of the season despite the exceptionally heavy rainfall in late April and early May.",Report Available,790,2021,20-RR-ETH-46461,34,Ethiopia,ETH,3,Rapid Response,8,Drought,Natural Disaster,Ethiopia RR Application Dec 2020 (Anticipatory Action - Drought),3,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,7184735,FAO;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WHO,19996683.0000,2020-12-24,2021-04-09,"To avert humanitarian outcomes like those caused by the droughts of 2011, 2015/16 or 2017/18, humanitarian partners in Ethiopia in cooperation with government counterparts, in 2020, set up an Anticipatory Action (AA) framework for drought, which was endorsed by the Humanitarian Country Team on 28 October. On 15 November, updated rainfall forecasts were published, predicting a 50 per cent probability of below-average rainfall for the spring rainy season in Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' (SNNP) region of Ethiopia. In addition, food security experts project 40.8 per cent of SNNP region's population to face crisis levels of food insecurity (IPC phase 3) or worse between February and May 2021, representing more than a five per cent deterioration compared to the current food insecurity situation. These conditions mean that the trigger thresholds for the AA framework have been reached, occasioning the activation of the framework and CERF allocation. Further to SNNP region, the trigger is also very close to being reached in Afar, Oromia and Somali regions. Several woredas in Afar, SNNP and Somali regions have already been affected by below-average rainfall during the past short rainy season. A combination of two consecutive poor seasons would be disastrous for the affected people, several of whom are projected to face emergency levels of food insecurity (IPC phase 4) in the spring of 2021.


Following the triggering of the Anticipatory Action Framework, the Humanitarian Coordinator in Ethiopia together with the Cluster Leads Agencies proposed a ""phased activation"" approach whereas a set of time-critical activities with longer lead times were funded by CERF in December 2020 and a second set of activities, scheduled to be implemented later, are funded by CERF in March 2020, following re-confirmation of forecast below-average rainfall for the March-June season. This phased approach allows action as early as necessary and with the highest confidence possible. Overall, CERF is providing $20 million ($13.2 million in December 2020 and $6.8 million in March 2021) to support anticipatory activities in the agriculture, education, health, nutrition, protection and water and hygiene sectors."

According to regional and zonal governments, over 1.9 million livestock had died as of late March 2022, nearly a million more than in late February. In areas where crop production typically takes place, low soil moisture and limited inputs and draught power significantly limited cropping activities. Concurrently, prices for staple and non-staple food, including oil and grain, had increased as much as 32 per cent in some regions, driving vulnerable communities into increasingly severe food insecurity. According to FEWS NET, Emergency (IPC Phase 4) outcomes with populations in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) were widespread. Across drought and conflict-affected areas of Ethiopia, levels of acute malnutrition were extremely high. While screening was still ongoing and most screened woredas had not been fully assessed, proxy GAM rates in most areas were already ‘Critical’ or ‘Extremely Critical.’ Millions of households across Ethiopia, notably in southern, southeastern, and northern areas, required urgent humanitarian food assistance as they were experiencing moderate to extreme food consumption gaps as a result of conflict and drought, exacerbated by poor economic conditions. Humanitarian partners were prioritizing drought response, re-programming activities and scaling up assistance to meet the increased needs in support of the Government of Ethiopia. But given limited resources, the needs surpassed ongoing responses. Acknowledging the dire situation in drought-affected areas of Ethiopia, the humanitarian community developed a drought response plan that required an estimated US$550 million for a six-month period (January-June 2022), including scaling-up food and nutrition assistance, safe water provision, livelihood protection and other urgent humanitarian assistance to drought-stricken people across the country.",Report Available,898,2022,22-RR-ETH-52743,34,Ethiopia,ETH,3,Rapid Response,8,Drought,Natural Disaster,Ethiopia RR Application May 2022 (Food Security),3,"Meteorological, Hydrological and Climatological",1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,8200000,IOM;UNFPA;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,11999748.0000,2022-06-07,2022-06-14,"Food insecurity is increasing – and projected to continue to increase – in the Horn of Africa.

"The food security situation deteriorated especially in the country’s north due to poor rainfall, leaving an estimated 2.8 million people in IPC 3.The food security situation in the Arid and Semi-Arid Lands (ASAL) counties deteriorated following poor performance of the October-December 2021 short rains. This marked the third consecutive poor season in the pastoral, agropastoral and the marginal agricultural areas of the ASALs. The Kenya Food Security Steering Group’s (KFSSG) 2021 Mid-season Assessment indicated that an estimated 2.8 million people were in Crisis (IPC 3) across the ASALs. In pastoral areas, there had been poor regeneration of forage and below average recharge of surface water sources. Livestock deaths due the effects of drought, long trekking distance to water points and depleted pastures were reported to be over 1.4 million. In marginal agricultural areas, crop production in marginal was 70% below-average.

 The key strategic objective of this allocation is to sustain the momentum generated by the CERF rapid response allocation in October 2021 and to increase the life-saving response. Without this allocation, many of the hard-earned gains will be lost with far-reaching and devastating effects on drought-affected communities. The allocation has a clear geographic focus, targeting 7 priority counties, where the allocation will enhance the UN’s and the wider humanitarian community’s presence. This allocation will help diversify and strengthen partnerships with national and local implementing partners – including the Red Cross and a network of 30 local NGOs, community groups and women-led organizations – with a view to sustaining and reinforce already-existing community efforts to respond to the drought. The allocation sends a clear signal to donors about the importance and severity of needs. The allocation will also enhance political buy-in for sustained dialogue with the government regarding its plans to respond to the ongoing crisis. Finally, the RC will leverage the allocation to strengthen the UNCT’s advocacy efforts around resilience, sustainable solutions to longer-term climate-driven needs, effective early recovery, and mitigation of intercommunal tensions through conflict-sensitive programming.
The CERF allocation will support life-saving activities for 454,240 people, including 21,547 people with disabilities, across the Food Security, Nutrition, WASH, Health (including Sexual and Reproductive Health) and Protection (including Child Protection and GBV) through projects by FAO, UNFPA, UNICEF, UNFPA, WFP and WHO."
"By early 2022, drought had worsened in Somalia, with three consecutive below-average rainfall seasons. More than 3.2 million people in 66 out of the country’s 74 districts were affected by the drought at that moment; of whom 169,000 had abandoned their homes in search of water, food and pasture. With the March-April-May 2022 rainy season projected to also be below-average, Somalia was expecting to face the longest sequence of poor rains since 1981. Findings from a country wide rapid needs assessment completed on 6 December 2021 showed extreme impacts on already vulnerable populations. Prices of basic commodities had significantly risen above the reach of most families. For example, in Galmudug, the price of one barrel of water (200 liters) had increased from $1-3 to $2-8. In Shabelle, maize prices had risen by 34% to 58% in Shabelle and, in southern regions, vegetable oil prices had risen by 39% to 71%. Reports also showed widespread livestock deaths and a spike in the price of fodder. With rising prices for basic commodities, reduced livelihood opportunities from farming or agropastoralism, displaced people, as well as non–displaced in drought affected areas face conditions which create serious risks for their protection. Women and girls had to walk longer distances to collect water exposing them to risks of gender-based violence (GBV).

Catastrophic levels of food insecurity was declared for the first time since 2017, with 213,000 people in famine-like conditions and half the population – 7.8 million people – being acutely food insecure. Over 1 million people became displaced due to drought, and an estimated 1.5 million children under age 5 faced acute malnutrition. This included 386,400 children who will require emergency nutrition treatment to survive.

Between June and November 2022, the Protection and Return Monitoring Network (PRMN) reported 467,461 internally displaced people. The large-scale loss of livelihoods, including, shelters and assets, and the impact of the armed conflict, violence, and insecurity on affected communities has exposed affected populations to heightened protection risks. UNICEF reported an 80% increase in unaccompanied and separated children in IDP camps. These numbers spiked at the end of August and at the end of November 2022 triggering the CERF request.

The latest large-scale military engagement between Government forces and allies versus Al-Shabaab has resulted in displacement and the humanitarian needs of affected civilians are on the rise. This has also led to an extremely volatile security situation with consequent displacement in areas with limited pre-existing support, whose resilience has already been weakened by the protracted drought with nearing famine conditions. Since the beginning of military operations, the Protection and Return Monitoring Network (PRMN) has reported 467,461 internally displaced people. The large-scale loss of livelihoods, including, shelters and assets, and the impact of the armed conflict, violence, and insecurity on affected communities has exposed affected populations to heightened protection risks. As military operations are ongoing and potentially expand to the neighboring districts, it is expected that these numbers will continue to increase, at a current estimate of over 90,000 individuals per month.

"Since December 2020, the humanitarian situation in Somalia has undergone a severe decline. The consecutive failure of three rainy seasons resulted in the destruction of crop harvests and the deaths of livestock due to water scarcity and a lack of pasture. As a consequence, pastoral and agricultural communities lost their primary source of income and experienced displacement. The fourth rainy season, occurring from April to June 2022, also fell below average. Since the beginning of 2022, acute food insecurity in Somalia has significantly worsened.

By April, there were over 5,700 confirmed cases, primarily concentrated in the South-West and Littoral regions. The response in the South-West region was complicated by a variety of factors, including insecurity, which rendered humanitarian access challenging.

"Communities across South Sudan have been suffering from the effects of severe floods in three consecutive years. Typically, flooding in South Sudan fluctuates, with peaks seen during the wet season and flood waters receding up until April and May each year. However, according to analysis by the Centre for Humanitarian Data, as of the end of April, standing water levels were well above those recorded at the end of the 2021 dry season, which were extraordinarily high at the time, creating a situation in which even limited additional rain or water inflow could result in flooding and humanitarian suffering at or beyond the levels seen the year prior. Without mitigatory measures, an additional flood shock during the 2022 rainy season was projected to further aggravate vulnerability and humanitarian needs, particularly in recently flooded areas surrounding the Sudd wetlands, by compounding existing public health challenges, including outbreaks of Cholera and Hepatitis E, resulting in additional displacement, amplifying protection issues, and exacerbating an already dire food and nutrition situation. In Unity State, more than 320,000 people faced a high risk of flooding. Although some protective infrastructure was in place, especially around the Bentiu camp for internally displaced people (a former 'Protection of Civilians' site) and informal displacement sites in Bentiu town, without proper maintenance and reinforcement, additional dyke breaches were expected, which would have forced people to relocate to increasingly crowded areas at higher grounds, including the Bentiu IDP camp, where approximately 107,000 people were already located.",Report Available,889,2022,22-RR-SSD-52855,91,South Sudan,SSD,3,Rapid Response,6,Flood,Natural Disaster,South Sudan RR Application May 2022 (Early action for floods),3,Biological (human disease outbreak and other health emergency),1,Natural Disaster,1,Eastern Africa,1,Eastern Africa,1,Africa,0,FAO;IOM;UNFPA;UNHCR;UNICEF;WFP;WHO,14990010.0000,2022-05-16,2022-05-18,"Communities across South Sudan have suffered and continue to suffer from the effects of severe floods in three consecutive years.

The aim is to achieve better outcomes for the most vulnerable populations through collective action. Through the multisectoral integrated approach supported by the CERF allocation, the UN's humanitarian capacity will be visibly enhanced, increasing the UN's credibility as a humanitarian partner, to both government and non-UN humanitarian actors. The allocation will also create links between the humanitarian response and government- and UN-led resilience programmes. Specifically, the allocation will prioritize the local procurement of food, linking smallholder farmers with an emergency school feeding programme, to boost livelihoods in the short-term and promote sustainable food production over the long-term.

"The socio-economic and political crisis in the Central African Republic is at the root of a large-scale humanitarian and protection crisis. At the end of 2022, half a million of individuals were internally displaced and 60 per cent of them have been living in those harsh conditions for over two years. The precarious living conditions in the host locations and slight improvement of the security situation in certain parts of the country encouraged some people to return to their places of origin. These returns were often spontaneous and unassisted, leaving the returnee population to rebuild their lives with little or nothing. Insecurity, poor harvests, and the impact of the war in Ukraine resulting in disruptions in the supply chain, as well as export restrictions from Cameroon, caused prices to rise above the levels observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, local markets were affected by the volatile security situation, general access constraints exacerbated by deteriorating roads during the rainy season, and early depletion of food stocks. This resulted in a deterioration in food security and an increase malnutrition in CAR.

The southern part of the country was hit the hardest, but the flooding also struck some eastern provinces such as Sila causing rivers to overflow their banks. In the capital, N’Djamena, several neighborhoods are entirely submerged, with people having been forced to flee their homes.

"After a violent incident in 2020 that displaced more than 41,000 people, in January 2021, Sudan’s West Darfur state suffered yet another episode of conflict and intercommunal violence between Arab tribes and other ethnic groups. The clashes, which started on 15 January, resulted in the death of more than 200 people, the destruction of crops and vital water infrastructure and the looting of livestock and other livelihood assets. Within weeks, the violence displaced approx. 109,000 people across the Ag Geneina area. According to a February inter-agency needs assessment, many of those displaced by the clashes as well as their host communities required urgent humanitarian assistance, including food, shelter and health services. The recurrent violence in West Darfur added to the numerous other emergencies the country was facing at the time, including COVID-19, intercommunal clashes in South Kordofan and other Darfur states, flooding and an influx of more than 60,000 refugees from Tigray region into Sudan. Despite facing mounting levels of underfunding, the humanitarian community mobilized funds – mostly through reprogramming – to provide an initial response to the situation in West Darfur. However, anticipating an inability to sustain the response, the Humanitarian Coordinator requested supplementary funding from CERF to ensure a quick stabilization of the emergency as a means of protecting progress on broader efforts to build durable solutions in the Darfur region.",Report Available,807,2022,21-RR-SDN-47060,76,Republic of the Sudan,SDN,3,Rapid Response,16,Displacement,Conflict-related,Sudan RR Application Apr 2021 (Inter-communal violence in W Darfur),1,Conflict-related,2,Man-made,3,Northern Africa,3,Northern Africa,1,Africa,307775,FAO;IOM;UNFPA;UNICEF;WHO,4999194.0000,2021-04-20,2021-04-21,"Following intercommunal conflict and violence in West Darfur, approximately 109,000 people have been displaced, in particular across Ag Geneina locality.

UN agencies have started to respond to the current emergency by using available stocks, and re-prioritizing existing funding and interventions, but run short on stocks of relief supplies and funding.

A CERF allocation of $5 million will therefore allow the continuation of the early lifesaving response to urgent humanitarian needs caused by the sudden outbreak of intercommunal violence. This will also contribute to ongoing peacebuilding and stabilization efforts in West Darfur."
"The failing economy, prolonged dry spells and erratic rainfall in the 2021 rainy season had resulted in shortages and high cost of agricultural inputs and labor, reduced harvests and a decrease in cultivated area. Furthermore, crop production was impacted by the inflation, diseases outbreaks, and pest infestation. Small-scale farmers did not have the ability to procure seeds for the next agricultural season. The below-average rainy seasons had caused a shortage of water for domestic use and livestock, impacting livelihoods and access to drinking water. According to WFP and FAO, more than 18 million people were forecasted to face acute food insecurity by September 2022.

"Throughout 2021 and continuing in 2022, the Darfur region and South and West Kordofan witnessed increased humanitarian needs due to heightened intercommunal violence, often along transhumance routes, between farmer, agro-pastoralist and pastoral communities. In 2021, there was an eight-fold increase in the number of displaced people totaling 440,000 IDPs in the seven states. This increase in violence was seen against a backdrop of a worsened socio-economic and political crisis and reduced rainfall in 2021 affecting agricultural and livestock outputs and access to water. This reduced access to resources resulted in increased tensions and violence among communities. Although humanitarian agencies were providing assistance, critical needs remained unmet among the displaced people and host communities, across all sectors. Sentiments of exclusion of nomads and pastoralists further fueled tribal conflicts, leading to widespread displacements and loss of livelihoods.

"In early August 2022, satellite data and hydro-meteorological measuring stations in south-western Niger revealed a rainfall deficit for June and July 2022 that exceeded the agreed-upon trigger threshold for the Niger anticipatory action framework for drought: the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) value for that year (cumulative rainfall from June 1 to July 31 2022) placed it within the 35% of years with greatest rainfall deficits. The deficit was particularly significant in the regions of Tillabéri, Dosso, Maradi, Tahoua, Zinder and Niamey.

In response, the Emergency Relief Coordinator on 2 August allocated $2 million from CERF’s rapid response window for life-saving humanitarian action and as a continuation of the previous response to this crisis that started in 2021."
"Honduras faced multidimensional risks in protection, health, and food security. These risks were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Hurricanes Eta and Iota which struck in late 2020, displacement, and migration - leading to a deterioration of the humanitarian situation. Vulnerable populations such as women, boys and girls, informal workers, migrants, indigenous and Afro-descendant people as well as people with disabilities were among the most affected. During 2020 and 2021, violence against women and girls increased dramatically. Twenty per cent of children were stunted amidst rising food insecurity, and an estimated 278,000 children needed urgent humanitarian assistance.

The CERF allocation will respond to the three humanitarian priorities identified above, focusing on food security, protection and health care. The CERF allocation will focus on reinforcing the UN and wider Humanitarian Country Team presence in seven key departments where the response has been limited due to the lack of funding but where urgent humanitarian needs in food security, health and protection exist. CERF funds will be used to improve the protection environment specifically for women, children and adolescents while preventing catastrophic food-insecurity and worsened health conditions in the targeted areas. In the context of a dramatic increase in violence against women and girls a CERF-funded GBV response will prioritize immediate response services and protection of women and girls, bringing these services closer to affected people through strategies that include mobile response services, remote care, and safe spaces for GBV survivors. CERF-funded activities will link up with existing actions being taken in the priority clusters identified, reinforcing complementarity and the cost-efficient use of funds. In addition, CERF funds will better position the UN system to receive additional donor funding, including for the HRP, and strengthen buy-in from the new government, led by Honduras' first female president Xiomara Castro, and other local actors, thus facilitating a more coherent and coordinated response to the humanitarian needs in Honduras. 

The CERF allocation will support life-saving activities for a total of 118,800 people across the Food Security, Health, and Protection (Child Protection and GBV) sectors through projects by FAO, PAHO-WHO, UNHCR, UNICEF and UNFPA, with another 100,000, potentially, seeking attention in health care facilities."

The flooding impacted 35 of the country’s 75 districts, with the Ministry of Home Affairs reporting at the time that over 80 percent of the land in the Terai – Nepal’s breadbasket – was inundated. Yet it is often possible to predict severe monsoon flooding events and a targeted anticipatory approach can lead to a more timely, effective, efficient and dignified solution to respond to and ultimately reduce humanitarian needs.

"Following intense fighting in the first months of 2022, the political and conflict environment shifted significantly in April upon the announcement of a UN-brokered truce. Localized clashes continued in some areas, including in Taiz and Ad Dale’ and tensions had increased following the truce's expiry in November 2022. Apart from the conflict, the continued fragility of Yemen’s economy in 2022 exacerbated vulnerabilities among poor families, including as a result of depreciation of the Yemeni rial, macroeconomic instability, the de facto separation of economic institutions and issuance of competing monetary policies and decreasing household purchasing power. Being largely reliant on imported food and goods, Yemen is extremely vulnerable to fluctuations in global prices. 

The findings of the 2022 Multi-Cluster Location Assessment (MCLA) highlighted several types of vulnerabilities and the specific needs of vulnerable populations.

"Syria remains one of the largest and most complex humanitarian crises in the world, with over 14.6 million in need of humanitarian assistance, the great majority of them women and children. Eleven years of conflict have resulted in the forced displacement of over 11 million people and the large-scale destruction of homes, public infrastructure and services, including health care, education and water and sanitation. The conflict, combined with the impact of economic collapse, the effects of climate change and repeated natural disasters, including both drought and floods, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic, is deepening humanitarian needs and giving rise to increasing food insecurity, financial hardship and eroding coping capacities. Between 2021 and 2022, the number of people in need increased by over 9 per cent, despite the conflict becoming increasingly localized.

Amid growing scarcity, an ever-increasing number of families have found themselves unable to afford or access limited basic goods and services. Fast-increasing multi-sector needs and negative coping mechanisms have been documented within all communities residing in Lebanon. Indicators suggest that the most vulnerable households have crossed emergency thresholds and require emergency assistance with a 2021 UN-ESCWA study assessing a staggering 82% of people in Lebanon in 2021 as living in multi-dimensional poverty. The Lebanon Emergency Response Plan (ERP) has only received $36.2 million (9.5%) of the total request of $383 million.



The CERF allocation will be used to strategically support critically underfunded priorities within the Lebanon Emergency Response Plan (ERP). To maximize the impact of the CERF allocation, the HCT has identified a portfolio of multi-sectoral projects under the health and protection sectors, targeting previously unsupported vulnerable communities with packages of integrated lifesaving and life-sustaining services. Refugees are not directly targeted. Instead, attention will be given to migrant caseloads, specifically targeted under the ERP, who require a tailored, integrated package of health and protection support to meet their needs. The allocation will also critically reinforce service provision to women and girls, both survivors and those at risk of GBV and other protection issues, as well as support reproductive health services and commodities.  The HC will leverage the CERF allocation to support the localization agenda. The CERF allocation will support life-saving activities for a total of 219,921 affected people across the Health, Protection (CP and GBV) sectors, as well as activities targeting migrants.  The projects will be implemented by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and IOM."

"Lebanon is experiencing a constantly evolving multi-layered crisis which is exacerbating long-term structural vulnerabilities, reversing previously made development gains, and leading to acute and increasingly visible humanitarian needs among the most vulnerable populations. The financial and socio-economic crisis, compounded by the lack of reforms, the political impasse, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of the Ukrainian crisis, has further deteriorated leading to a significant increase in humanitarian needs. 2.5 million Lebanese, migrants and Palestine refugees are estimated to be in need humanitarian assistance, in addition to 1.5 million Syrian refugees. As many as 2.2 million people need food assistance in 2022, while 1.95 million people need support to access critical health assistance.

"The occupied Palestinian territory (OPT) is one of the most complex and challenging environments in which the United Nations operates. The OPT remains a protracted political crisis characterized by 55 years of Israeli military occupation. This crisis is exacerbated by a lack of adherence to international humanitarian and human rights law, internal Palestinian divisions and the recurrent escalation of hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups, with the most severe and deadly of these cycles currently ongoing since 7 October. 
Even prior to the current crisis, there have been increased vulnerabilities and needs resulting from 16 years of Israeli-imposed blockade on Gaza,  repeated closure of Israeli-controlled borders, frequent displacement, the excessive use of force on Palestinians, as well as the consequences of demolitions, evictions, settler expansion and settler violence.  
Israeli-controlled border closures, which have limited travel, ability to see family or access work, have had an impact on mental wellbeing and socio-economic status of Palestinians. Displacement has resulted in negative health and education outcomes, and affected the access to water, hygiene and sanitation. The destruction of productive assets has contributed to unemployment, poverty, food insecurity, and eventually aid dependency. Finally, the consistent denial of rights and threats to Palestinian wellbeing and living standards, have hindered socioeconomic progress, further contributing to insecurity. Meanwhile, funding levels for the 2023 Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) remained exceptionally low, requiring the humanitarian community to prioritize life-saving activities, unable to meet all the humanitarian needs.
Just prior to events of 7 October, there has been an increase in conflict-related injuries and fatalities across the West Bank, increase in settler violence, and stringent movement restrictions amidst a shrinking funding environment. Tensions have risen in both Gaza and the West Bank. 
The escalation since October 7 has turned an already serious humanitarian situation into a catastrophic one. The entire Strip is under a full blackout, fuel for essential services is scarce with services collapsing, while intense airstrikes continue across the Gaza Strip, resulting in a cumulative fatality toll of over 7,000 among Palestinians in Gaza, where 66 percent are children and women.

"A devastating series of earthquakes and aftershocks in the early hours of 06 February 2023, originating close to Gaziantep, Türkiye, has impacted vast parts of the area of operations (AoO) in Syria. As of 12 February, at least 5,791 people had reportedly been killed and  10,041 injured. Overall, the humanitarian community estimates that 8.8 million people live in areas that have been affected by the earthquake in Syria and have been impacted in varying degrees. These numbers likely under-represent the true scale of needs. 

This situation has led to a severe shelter (and broadly NFIs) crisis due to the destruction/damage to buildings where the affected people used to live; water installations have either been destroyed or heavily damaged, remaining health facilities are struggling to cope with the increase in number of patients and dwindling supplies, and protection concerns (including CP and GBV) have increased. Several other factors are influencing and exacerbating the severity of humanitarian needs, including pre-existing large scale humanitarian needs, logistical and access constraints to certain areas, winter conditions and an ongoing cholera outbreak.

"In the early morning of 6 February 2023, a devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck Pazarcık, Kahramanmaraş, in Türkiye, and surrounding areas. The initial earthquake was followed by thousands of aftershocks. This was the second largest earthquake in Türkiye in the last century, and the most significant to strike the country’s south-east region in hundreds of years, according to the International Federation of the Red Cross. The earthquakes and aftershocks caused catastrophic devastation. As of 14 February, 31,974 people had lost their lives in Kahramanmaraş, Gaziantep, Şanlıurfa, Diyarbakır, Adana, Adıyaman, Osmaniye, Hatay, Kilis and Malatya and Elazığ.  The earthquake hit communities at the peak of winter, leaving hundreds of thousands of people—including small children and the elderly—without access to shelter, food, water, heating, and medical care in freezing cold temperatures. Over 6,400 houses were destroyed or damaged and thousands of people sought refuge in makeshift shelters across Türkiye, including schools, mosques, and other temporary shelters allocated by the government. Thousands of pregnant women who needed access to maternal health services were living in the affected areas and had to give birth under the most difficult circumstances.

The 2023 HRP, which targets 5.2 million people, focuses predominantly on people in need in rural areas, aiming to alleviate suffering for people facing acute vulnerabilities such as mental and physical disability; those using emergency coping strategies; internally displaced people and returnees; and those living in households headed by women, children, or the elderly with an emphasis on addressing food insecurity, reinforcing protection from sexual exploitation and abuse; preventing and responding to gender-based violence; strengthening gender, mental health and psychosocial support; and promoting and delivering on disability inclusion.

In response, the Emergency Relief Coordinator on 18 May 2023 allocated $10 million from CERF's rapid response window for life-saving humanitarian action. The CERF-funded response will focus on addressing immediate priorities in the worst affected areas such as shelter, NFIs, WASH, and protection. This response targets the most vulnerable, including people whose homes have been destroyed, and people displaced by conflict and past inter-communal violence in regions like Rakhine, Chin, Sagaing, and Magway. This funding is particularly crucial given the new needs in areas of extreme poverty already facing humanitarian challenges due to conflict, displacement, political, and economic instability. The allocation is critical to continuing the urgent humanitarian response, particularly given that the 2023 Myanmar Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) is less than 10% funded, with a $764 million requirement. The CERF allocation will complement a Myanmar Humanitarian Fund (MHF) $2 million Emergency Reserve allocation in response to the cyclone, with a further funds from a larger MHF standard allocation expected to further bolster the cyclone-effort."
"Starting 27 October 2023, Myanmar experiencing the most intense and geographically extensive armed clashes the country has witnessed since the 2021 military takeover. In less than two months, more than 660,000 people have been newly displaced across multiple states and regions, taking total displacement to 2.6m nationwide. The recent escalation in hostilities in both pre-existing conflict hotspots, as well as in new locations previously not heavily affected by post-takeover conflict, has triggered a sudden and significant increase in needs across the country. This ‘emergency within an emergency’ is quickly outstripping the limited resources of UN agencies and their partners to respond. 
The surge in new displacement is creating an urgent need for scaled-up assistance to both newly displaced and protracted IDPs, as well as host communities. Humanitarian partners have identified the most urgent humanitarian needs as food, safe shelter, non-food items and hygiene kits, basic health services and protection support.

"Panama is facing one of the decade's most complex mixed movement crises. In 2022, nearly 250,000 people from 70 nationalities crossed irregularly through Darien, making it the year with the most crossings in Panamanian history. The current crisis has been triggered by an unprecedented number of people crossing the dangerous Darien gap and numbers keep increasing. Authorities estimate that by the end of 2023, the numbers recorded in 2022 will at a minimum double. 20% of this population are children, often unaccompanied. Darien is considered the most dangerous jungle in the world and Darien Province and the Embera Comarca are areas with the highest levels of deprivation in the country and homes to indigenous communities. 

Based on official records, there is evidence of an increase in the number of people in need of protection entering Panamanian territory as part of mixed movements. In the latter, 58% reported being victims of threats, intimidation, and attacks. There was also an increase in the number of people describing drownings and death of other people on the move due to flash flooding of rivers coupled with psychological trauma, and often physical injury, dehydration, hunger, diarrhea, skin and respiratory infections, and family separation. These phenomena will continue in the coming weeks as the rainy season begins in the region.

Since November 2022, the Nyiragongo health zone has registered a significant increase in suspected cases, with over 550 cases in week 50 alone and 3 confirmed deaths, thereby triggering the anticipatory action model and associated activities.  In response to the trigger threshold being met, the main implementing partners of this pilot, UNICEF and WHO, will together receive $750,000 in order to provide health and WASH assistance to 236,000 people at risk of contracting Cholera. This allocation will complement the recent Rapid Response allocation by targeting health zones surrounding Nyiragongo in order to prevent a further spread of the disease."

Such a large presence of refugees has exacerbated the economic, environmental and development challenges faced by the host communities. In 2023, refugees from the DRC are continuing to cross to Uganda due to ongoing instability in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. Funding for Uganda’s refugee plan has dwindled in the past years, and it is now considered one of the world’s most underfunded refugee situations. The capacity of partners to provide lifesaving support to new arrivals and basic assistance to refugees has diminished; this has manifested as significant reductions in food rations, cuts in the distribution of hygiene kits and soap, and undue strains on public services (water and sanitation, healthcare, and education) in settlements. Partners continue to prioritize the delivery of essential services, but more involvement and support from development actors, as agreed through the Global Compact on Refugees, is needed. Humanitarian needs for other communities in Uganda are also rising due to the successive droughts since 2020. Low household purchasing power, disease outbreaks and localized conflict have further exacerbated conditions.

More than 18,000 flooded houses were damaged. Several thousand hectares of rice fields were flooded to a point which no longer allows for the re-launching of the agricultural campaign, likely leading to harvest losses in May. Furthermore, the floods left nearly 220,000 people in need of drinking water and sanitation facilities, increasing the likelihood of infant mortality, malnutrition, and epidemics such as polio and cholera. Additionally, the strong winds destroyed nearly 800 houses and damaged 165 classrooms, leaving nearly 21,000 students without classes. 22 health facilities were partially damaged. Physical access to health services is further hampered as the roads connecting villages to district health centers were damaged.

Further escalation in hostilities since late January 2024 has led to even mroe substantial displacement, affecting both previously displaced individuals and local residents. In North Kivu and in particularly in Goma, IDPs have nearly double since August 2023, exceeding 297,000 people, predominantly women and children. South Kivu has also seen an increase in displacement, and the total displaced population in South Kivu has now reached over 280,000 people. The displacement crisis exacerbates vulnerabilities among displaced populations and host communities across North and South Kivu. Humanitarian efforts must prioritize decongesting displacement sites, ensuring access to clean water, sanitation, basic healthcare, and food. Protection, particularly for women and children, education support, and hygiene kits for adolescent girls, are crucial. In response to the crisis, CERF allocated $20 million in February 2024 from its Underfunded Emergencies window for the immediate commencement of life-saving activities. The CERF allocation will focus on providing lifesaving assistance to over 679,000 people in North and South Kivu, including 134,000 women and 431,000 children, and including 33,700 people with disabilities in the Food Security (assistance and Agriculture), Protection (including GBV and child protection), Shelter and NFI, Camp coordination and management, and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) sectors."

About 25 million people – of whom over 14 million are children – need humanitarian assistance and support. More than 8 million people – about 15 per cent of the total population of the country – have fled their homes since the conflict started. They have sought refuge within Sudan or in neighbouring countries, making Sudan the largest new displacement crisis in the world currently. This displacement crisis is further compounded by a food crisis as well as a protection  crisis. 

This allocation focuses on the needs stemming from the food and protection crisis, with a focus on the Kordofan and Darfur states and Khartoum. Beyond providing immediate life-saving assistance, the allocation aims to serve as a catalyst in securing critical stakeholder support, including from different parties of the conflict, to provide access, safety and security required for the UN-led response at large to continually target places most in need."

Coordinated attacks, orchestrated by armed gangs, targeted people and critical infrastructure in Port-au-Prince, and later in Artibonite. Since 3 March, the country has been under a state of emergency. It is estimated that the wave of violence has displaced 50,000 people since the beginning of the year, affecting an additional 50,000 as host families. The latest IPC results show a 14% increase in acute food insecurity (5 million people now) and in people facing emergency levels of food insecurity (1.6 million). The closure of hospitals and health facilities is impacting hundreds of thousands.

The CERF allocation will strengthen the agencies' operational capacity to respond to the worsening political and security situation and the recent wave of violence in Port-au-Prince and Artibonite. The CERF funds will enable implementing agencies and partners to reach the hardest-hit people more quickly, including in hard-to-reach areas under the control or influence of armed gangs, and thus maintain people's access to services and humanitarians' access to populations. Without this allocation, access to people risks being lost. The CERF-funded response aims to address critical gaps created by the ongoing violence. The allocation will provide a multi-sectoral response (food security, water, sanitation and hygiene, protection and healthcare) to displaced people and host communities, treatment for acute malnutrition among children, and support to hospitals. The areas of operations are limited to Port-au-Prince and Artibonite."
"In 2023, Mauritania witnessed a steadily higher influx of refugees due to the deterioration of the security situation in Mali, increasing from 12,000 in 2022 to 55,000 in 2023 and reaching a peak in December that triggered the humanitarian partners to conduct rapid, multisectoral assessments.

The country's geographical location, with a vast coastline along the Bay of Bengal, makes it particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones therefore increasing the vulnerability of at-risk populations. To this end, collaborative efforts between local agencies and international organizations have led to the development of an Anticipatory Action framework which aims to anticipate and minimize the effects of severe storms by using pre-defined triggers. 
The threshold for triggering the readiness phase is reached when the Bangladesh Meteorological department (BMD) issues a Signal 1 (squally weather) or above warning with a lead time of 3-5 days (25% or more likely) or more and at least two models from BMD, Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Global Forecast System (GFS) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) forecast wind speeds of 125 km/h or greater in the coastal districts of Bangladesh. The threshold for triggering the action phase is reached when BMD issues a Signal 5 or above warning with a lead time of 48-72 hours (50% or more likely) or more and at least three models from BMD, IMD, ECMWF, GFS and JTWC forecast wind speeds of 125 km/h or greater in the coastal pilot districts with a lead time of 48-72 hours or more in the coastal pilot districts.

Malnutrition is set to increase due to the drought, which is alarming given that already 35 per cent of children under five are stunted and 4 per cent are acutely malnourished or wasted. Additionally, limited water availability not only compromises safe water access for people and livestock, but also heightens the risk of water-borne and vector-borne diseases – which is particularly concerning as Zambia is still recovering from a significant cholera outbreak.
